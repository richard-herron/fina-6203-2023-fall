## Real Assets versus Financial Assets

### Real assets generate income, whereas financial assets allocate income to investors

- Real assets
	- Produce goods and services
	- Tangible or intangible
	- Examples: Buildings, land, machines, and intellectual property
- Financial assets
	- Claims to the income generated by real assets (or income from the government)
	- Do not directly goods and services
	- Examples: Stocks and bonds

## Financial Assets

### There are three broad types of financial assets: fixed income, equity, and derivatives

- Fixed income securities: Promise a stream of income
- Equity: Represents an ownership share in a firm
- Derivative securities: Promise a payoff derived from financial variables, such as stock prices, interest rates, or exchange rates
- Other financial markets:
	- Currencies
	- Commodities


## Financial Markets and the Economy

### Financial assets help investors benefit from real assets

- Aggregate information
	- Stock prices reflect collective assessments of current and future performance
	- This reflection helps allocate capital to its best use
- Time consumption
	- Investing moves money from today to the future
	- Financing moves money from the future to today
- Allocate risk
	- Real assets have risk
	- Financial assets allocate this risk to investors who can bear it
- Separate ownership and management
	- Owners hire managers to run firms, leading to principal-agent conflicts
	- Principal-agent conflicts are when agents pursue their interests instead of those of the principals


### We can mitigate agency conflicts but not eliminate them

- Executive compensation plans align manager wealth and owner wealth
- Boards of directors monitor managers
- Investors and analysts monitor managers
- New investors take over poor-performing firms


## The Investment Process

### Investors use asset allocation and security selection to buy portfolios of assets

- Asset allocation chooses broad asset classes: stocks, bonds, real estate, commodities, etc.
- Security selection chooses specific investments: Apple common stock, 30-year Treasuries, commercial real estate in Boston, gold, etc.
- Portfolio construction approaches
	- Top-down: Allocate assets first, then select securities
	- Bottom-up: Select attractively-priced securities first, with or without an asset allocation target


## Markets Are Competitive

### Competitive markets have two implications

1.  Risk-return trade-off
	- All else equal, investors want low risk and high expected returns
	- If low-risk and high-expected-return assets existed, investors would buy them, pushing up prices until expected returns fell
	- *Therefore, higher-risk assets offer higher expected returns than lower-risk assets*
2.  Efficient markets
	- Security markets are typically "informationally efficient," and market prices quickly incorporate new information
	- *Therefore, market prices are consensus estimates of intrinsic values*


### However, the @grossman_impossibility_1980 paradox highlights that perfectly efficient markets are impossible

- If prices perfectly reflected all information, collecting and trading on information would not be profitable
- Therefore, small mispricings would not be eliminated because the cost of collecting and trading on information would exceed the benefit of profiting from small mispricings
- We assume market efficiency as a baseline, but markets are not perfectly efficient
- Market efficiency affects the choice between active and passive investment management
	- Active: Searches for mispriced securities
	- Passive: Holds a highly diversified portfolio instead of searching for mispriced securities


## The Players

### There are three major players in financial markets: firms, households, and governments

- Firms: Net demanders of capital, which they invest in real assets to generate income for investors
- Households: Typically net suppliers of capital, which they invest in firms and governments
- Governments: Borrowers or lenders of capital, depending on the timing


### Financial intermediaries connect capital suppliers and demanders

- Balance sheets of financial intermediaries are largely financial assets
- Examples: Investment companies, insurance companies, and credit unions
- Advantages: Pool investor resources, diversify assets, and achieve economies of scale


### There are several other participants in financial markets

- Investment bankers
	- Underwrite public securities to help firms raise capital
	- Provide corporate-finance consulting that is too expensive for firms to provide themselves
- Venture capital (VC) and private equity (PE)
	- VC provides early capital (and advice and expertise) to firms too young to issue public securities
	- PE provides capital (and advice and expertise) to firms too mismanaged to issue public securities
- Fintech
	- Technology that provides financial intermediation
	- Examples: Peer-to-peer lending, robo advisors, blockchains, and cryptocurrencies
