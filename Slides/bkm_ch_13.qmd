## Two-Pass Tests of Asset Pricing

### The CAPM assumes that beta explains why different securities offer different expected rates of return

- It is difficult to definitively test the CAPM since we cannot observe the true market portfolio
- The most common tests use a two-pass approach
	1. Use time-series returns to estimate the systematic risk
	2. Use a cross-section of returns to test if riskier assets have higher returns on average


### Testing the single-factor SML

- The CAPM proposes the following expected return-beta relation:
$$
E(r_i) = r_f + \beta_i [E(r_M) - r_f]
$$
- We can test this relation with a large sample of monthly stock returns for the same stocks over time:
	- $r_{it}$ for 100 stocks over 60 months
	- $r_{Mt}$ for the market index over 60 months
	- $r_{ft}$ for the risk-free rate over 60 months


### First pass: Estimate the SCLs
	
- We estimate the security characteristic line (SCL) for each security:
$$
r_{it} - r_{ft} = a_i + b_i (r_{Mt} - r_{ft}) + e_{it}
$$
- We collect the following statistics:
	- $\overline{r_i - r_f}$ is the sample average excess return for each of the 100 stocks
	- $b_i$ is the estimate of $\beta$ for each of the 100 stocks
	- $\overline{r_M - r_f}$ is the sample average excess return for the market index
	- $\sigma^2(e_i)$ is the variance of the residuals for each of the 100 stocks


### Second pass: Estimate the SML

- We estimate the security market line (SML) for the market:
$$
\overline{r_i - r_f} = \gamma_0 + \gamma_1 b_i
$$
- The CAPM predicts:
	- $\gamma_0 = 0$
	- $\gamma_1 = \overline{r_M - r_f}$
- We can also add $\sigma^2(e_i)$ and estimate:
$$
\overline{r_i - r_f} = \gamma_0 + \gamma_1 b_i + \gamma_2 \sigma^2(e_i)
$$
- The CAPM predicts:
	- $\gamma_0 = 0$
	- $\gamma_1 = \overline{r_M - r_f}$
	- $\gamma_2 = 0$


### These two-pass tests do not support the CAPM

- The SML is too flat (i.e., $\gamma_1 < \overline{r_M - r_f}$), and the intercept is too large (i.e., $\gamma_0 > 0$)
- There  are several difficulties with these two-pass tests
	1. Stock returns are extremely volatile, reducing the precision of average return estimates
	1. We have fundamental concerns about the structure of these two-pass tests
		a. The market index is not the CAPM's market portfolio
		a. First-stage betas are estimated with sampling error
		a. Investors cannot borrow at the risk-free rate


### Roll's critique of the CAPM

1. The CAPM has a single testable hypothesis: The market portfolio is mean-variance efficient
1. All other CAPM implications (e.g., a linear relation between expected return and beta) are not independently testable
1. If we estimate betas against mean-variance efficient portfolios, they will satisfy the SML relation exactly *ex post* regardless of whether the true market portfolio is mean-variance efficient *ex ante*
1. The CAPM is not testable unless we include *all assets* in the sample
1. Using  a market index proxy is subject to two difficulties:
	a. The proxy may be mean-variance efficient even when the true market portfolio is not
	a. Most proxies are correlated, but different proxies can lead to different conclusions


### Measurement error in beta

- Problem: If beta has measurement error and appears as a right-hand-side variable in the second-pass regression:
	- $\gamma_1$ will be biased downward
	- $\gamma_0$ will be biased upward
- Solution: Build portfolios on beta ranks
	- @fama_risk_1973 estimate the following regression:
	$$
	\overline{r_i - r_f} = \gamma_0 + \gamma_1 b_i + \gamma_2 b_i^2 + \gamma_3 \sigma^2(e_i)
	$$
	where $i$ indicates a diversified portfolio formed on first-pass betas
	- They find:
		- $\gamma_0 \approx 0$
		- $0 < \gamma_1 < \overline{r_M - r_f}$ 
		- $\gamma_2 \approx 0$
		- $\gamma_3 \approx 0$


### However, recent years have not been kind to the CAPM

- The relation between average returns and beta has weakened
- @fama_cross_1992 show $\gamma_1 \approx 15$ basis points per month instead of the observed excess return of $\approx 35$ basis points
- *There is more to the risk-return relation than the CAPM captures*

## Tests of the Multifactor Models

### Three types of factors are likely to augment the market risk factor in a multifactor SML

- These three types of factors are:
	1. Factors that hedge consumption against uncertainty in prices (e.g., housing or energy)
	1. Factors that hedge future investment opportunities (e.g., interest rates or market volatility)
	1. Factors that hedge assets missing from the market index (e.g., labor income or private business)
- Merton's ICAPM suggests that these extra-market sources of risk will command a risk premium if investors demand to hedge them


## Fama-French-Type Factor Models

### The @fama_common_1993 3-factor model is state-of-the-art {.allowframebreaks}

- @fama_common_1993 add two factors to the CAPM to explain:
	- Higher book-to-market firms experience higher returns (HML)
	- Smaller firms experience higher returns (SMB)
- They find that value and size are priced risk factors

### Relations between fundamental sources of asset risk and SMB and HML strengthens their case

### HML has behavioral explanations {.allowframebreaks}

- Glamour firms
	- Recent good performance
	- High prices
	- Low book-to-market ratios
	- Therefore, they tend to underperform value firms
- Overreaction
	- High *past* growth is extrapolated and then impounded in price
- Extrapolation error
	- Investors ignore evidence that they cannot extrapolate past growth far into the future

### Momentum is the fourth factor

- Momentum is the fourth factor added to the @fama_common_1993 model
- The winners-minus-losers (WML) portfolios determine winners and losers based on the past 1 to 12 months of returns
- However, WML is hard to interpret as an obvious source of risk

## Liquidity and Asset Pricing 

### Liquidity is difficult to measure with a single statistic

- Liquidity involves the following:
	- Trading costs
	- Ease of sale
	- Price concessions to effect a quick transaction
	- Market depth
	- Price predictability
- Popular measures of liquidity focus on price impact


### Three popular measures of liquidity {.allowframebreaks}

- Pastor and Stambaugh
	- Look for evidence of price reversals, especially following large trades
	- The original price change was a concession on the part of trade initiator who needed to offer (accept) a higher (lower) purchase price to complete their trade promptly
- Amihud
	- Focuses on large trades and price movements
	- Defined as:
	$$
	\text{ILLIQ} = \text{Monthly average of daily} \left( \frac{|\text{Stock return}|}{\text{Dollar volume}} \right)
	$$
- Sadka
	- Uses trade-by-trade data
	- The liquidity of firms can vary as the prevalence of informationally motivated trades varies

## Consumption-Based Asset Pricing and the Equity Premium Puzzle

### Equity premium puzzle: Returns are too high given that consumption varies so little
 
- Systematic consumption risk is too low to justify the observed market excess returns
- Unless we assume implausibly high levels of risk aversion
- Recent research has improved estimation using consumption-tracking portfolios


### The consumption CAPM (CCAPM) implies that investors care about their lifetime consumption flows instead of wealth

![Cross section of stock returns: Fama-French 25 portfolios, 1954--2003 [@bodie_investments_2023, Figure 13.7]](./Figures/bod12665_1307.png){height=50%}


### Fama and French attribute the equity premium puzzle to unexpected capital gains after 1949

![](./Figures/table_1300.png){height=50%}


### Survivorship bias may explain the equity premium puzzle

An asterisk indicates that the market suffered a long break. [@bodie_investments_2023, Figure 13.8]](./Figures/bod12665_1308.png){height=50%}


### Liquidity may explain the equity premium puzzle

- The illiquidity premium may have the same order of magnitude as the market risk premium
- Part of the average excess return is likely compensation for  *liquidity*  risk rather than just systematic risk
- The equity premium puzzle may be less of a puzzle than it first appears


### There are behavioral explanations for the equity premium puzzle

- Barberis and Huang explain the puzzle as an outcome of irrational investor behavior
- Premium results from two factors:
	- Narrow framing: Investors evaluate every risk in isolation
	- Loss aversion: Investors are more sensitive to losses than gains
- Investors focus on total volatility instead of the low correlation of a stock portfolio with other components of wealth
- Require higher risk premiums than rational models would predict
