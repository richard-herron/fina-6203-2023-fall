## The Conventional Theory of Performance Evaluation

### The difference between *arithmetic* and *geometric* averages

- Suppose we evaluate the performance of a portfolio over a 20-year holding period
- The *arithmetic average* is the sum of the 20 annual returns divided by 20:
$$
\overline{r} = \frac{\sum_{t=1}^{20} r_t}{20}
$$
- The *geometric average* is the constant annual return $r_G$ that provides the same cumulative return:
$$
r_G = [(1+r_1)(1+r_2)\cdots(1+r_{20})]^{1/20} - 1
$$


### The difference between time-weighted and dollar-weighted averages {.allowframebreaks}

- The *time-weighted* average weights each period's return the same, which is the *geometric average*
- The *dollar-weighted* average weights each period's return by the amount invested in that period, with is the internal rate of return (IRR)

**Example:**
A stock sells for $50.
You purchase one share today and one more in one year.
At the end of the second year, you sell both shares for $54.
Dividends of $2 per share are paid annually at the end of each year (but before shares sales).

| **Time** | **Outlays** |
| :-: | :-- |
| 0 | $50 to purchase the first share |
| 1 | $53 to purchase a second share a year later |
|   | **Proceeds** |
| 1 | $2 dividend from initially purchased share |
| 2 | $4 dividend from the 2 shares held in the second year, plus |
|   | $108 received from selling both shares at $54 each |

- The **time-weighted** average (geometric average) is 7.81%:
$$
\begin{aligned}
r_1 &= \frac{53+2-50}{50}=0.1 \\
r_2 &= \frac{54+2-53}=0.0566 \\
r_G &= (1.10 \times 1.0566)^{1/2}-1 \implies r_G=0.0781
\end{aligned}
$$
- The **dollar-weighted** average (IRR) is 7.12%:
$$
0 = -50 + \frac{-53 + 2}{1+r} + \frac{112}{(1+r)^2} \implies r=0.0712
$$

### We must risk-adjust returns to compare them {.allowframebreaks}

- The simplest and most popular risk adjustment is to compare rates of return with those of other investment funds with similar risk characteristics
- **Comparison universe:** 
  - The set of money managers with similar investment styles used to assess the relative performance of a manager
  - For example, a 90\textsuperscript{th} percentile manager provides higher returns than 90% of managers in her comparison universe
- Comparison universes are simple and intuitive, but have the following shortcomings:
  - Managers concentrate in subgroups within their comparison universe
  - Comparison universes are not investable (e.g., we cannot invest in the median manager)

### There are several popular risk-adjusted performance measures

- **Sharpe ratio** $\left( \frac{\overline{r}_P - \overline{r}_f}{\sigma_P} \right)$ measures the reward to total risk trade-off
- **Treynor ratio** $\left( \frac{\overline{r}_P - \overline{r}_f}{\beta_P} \right)$ measures the reward to systematic risk trade-off
- **Jensen's alpha** $\left( \alpha_P = \overline{r}_P - \left[ \overline{r}_f + \beta_P \left( \overline{r}_M - \overline{r}_f \right) \right] \right)$ is the average return on the portfolio over the CAPM-predicted return, given the portfolio's beta and the average market return
- **Information ratio** $\left( \frac{\alpha_P}{\sigma(e_P)} \right)$ divides portfolio alpha by its nonsystematic risk, so it measures abnormal return per unit of diversifiable risk


### The $M^2$ performance measure presents the Sharpe ratio as an excess return

- Lever or unlever portfolio $P$ to match the volatility of the passive market index
- This portfolio $P^*$ has the same volatility as the passive market index
- $M^2_P$ is the excess return on portfolio $P^*$:
$$
M^2_P = r_{P^*} - r_M
$$


### $M^2_P$ can be negative, even when $r_P > r_M$

![The $M^2_P$ of portfolio $P$ is negative even though its average return was greater than that of the market index, $M$ [@bodie_investments_2023, Figure 24.2]](./Figures/bod12665_2402.png){height=50%}


### The Treynor ratio considers *systematic* risk, so it is useful for assembling a diversified fund-of-funds {.allowframebreaks}

![Treynor measures of two portfolios and the market index [@bodie_investments_2023, Figure 24.3]](./Figures/bod12665_2403.png){height=50%}


### The information ratio measures the trade-off between alpha and diversifiable risk

- So, the information ratio is useful for adding an active portfolio to a passive portfolio
- For example, *optimally() combining active fund $H$ with market index $M$ improves the Sharpe ratio as follows:
$$
S_P^2 = S_M^2 + \left[ \frac{\alpha_H}{\sigma(e_H)} \right]^2
$$

### When should we apply each risk-adjusted performance measure?

| **Performance Measure** | **Definition**  | **Application**  |
| :-- | :-- | :-------- |
| Sharpe | $\frac{\overline{r}_P - \overline{r}_f}{\sigma_P}$ | When choosing among portfolios competing for the overall risky portfolio |
| Treynor | $\frac{\overline{r}_P - \overline{r}_f}{\beta_P}$ | When ranking many portfolios that will be mixed to form the overall risky portfolio |
| Information ratio | $\frac{\alpha_P}{\sigma(e_P)}$ | When evaluating a portfolio to be mixed with a diversified benchmark portfolio |

### How does alpha relate to each risk-adjusted performance measure?

| | **Treynor** | **Sharpe** | **Information Ratio** |
| :-- | :-- | :--- | :-- |
| Relation to alpha | $\frac{E(r_P)-r_f}{\beta_P} = \frac{\alpha_p}{\beta_P} + T_M$ | $\frac{E(r_P)-r_f}{\sigma_P} = \frac{\alpha_p}{\sigma_P} + \rho S_M$ | $\frac{\alpha_P}{\sigma(e_p)}$ |
| Improvement compared to the market | $T_P - T_M = \frac{\alpha_p}{\beta_P}$ | $S_P - S_M = \frac{\alpha_p}{\sigma_P} - (1-\rho) S_M$ | $\frac{\alpha_P}{\sigma(e_p)}$ |

### An application of risk-adjusted performance measures {.allowframebreaks}

![Excess returns for portfolios $P$ and $Q$ and the market index $M$ over 12 months [@bodie_investments_2023, Table 24.2]](./Figures/table_2402.png){height=50%}

![Performance statistics [@bodie_investments_2023, Table 24.3]](./Figures/table_2403.png){height=50%}

- If $P$ or $Q$ represents the entire investment, $Q$ is better because of its higher Sharpe ratio
- If $P$ and $Q$ are potential sub-portfolios, $Q$ remains better because of its higher Treynor ratio
- However, if we seek an active portfolio to mix with an index portfolio, $P$ is better because of its higher information ratio

### Realized returns versus expected returns

- We must determine the statistical "significance level" of a performance measure to determine whether it reliably indicates any ability
- Even moderate levels of statistical noise make it difficult to evaluate performance 

<!-- TODO: Add example calculation of N given sigma -->


### Regardless of the performance criterion, some funds will outperform their benchmarks in any year, and some will underperform {.allowframebreaks}

- Performance in one period does not predict future performance
- Limiting a sample of funds to those with available returns over an entire sample period introduces **survivorship bias**

## Style Analysis

### *Style analysis* measures the exposures of managed portfolios to asset classes {.allowframebreaks}

- Introduced by William Sharpe
- Regress fund returns on indexes representing a range of asset classes
  - The coefficient on each index measures the fund's implicit allocation to each "style"
  - The intercept coefficient measures the average return from security selection
  - $R^2$ measures the percentage of return variability attributable to style choice instead of security selection

## Performance Measurement with Changing Portfolio Composition

### Risk-adjusted performance measures assume constant portfolio risk, which is not necessarily true

![Portfolio returns: Returns in last four quarters are more variable than in the first four [@bodie_investments_2023, Figure 24.6]](./Figures/bod12665_2406.png){height=50%}


### Managers may game the risk-adjusted performance measures above

- The Sharpe ratio is invariant to the fraction $y$ of the portfolio invested in the risky portfolio instead of the risk-free asset
- However, increasing leverage after the first period of an evaluation period increases the influence of second-period performance
  - If early returns are bad, increase leverage in the second period
  - If early returns are good, decrease leverage in the second period
  - This strategy creates a negative correlation between first-period and second-period returns, which reduces the Sharpe ratio denominator $\sigma_P$


### The Morningstar risk-adjusted rating (MRAR) is impossible to manipulate! {.allowframebreaks}

- MRAR is the risk-free equivalent excess return of the portfolio for an investor with risk aversion $\gamma$:
$$
\text{MRAR}(\gamma) = \left[ \frac{1}{T} \sum_{t=1}^T \left( \frac{1+r_t}{1+r_{ft}} \right)^{-\gamma} \right]^{\frac{12}{\gamma}} - 1
$$
- MRAR and Sharpe ratio rankings are similar

![Rankings based on Morningstar's RAR versus Sharpe ratio [@bodie_investments_2023, Figure 24.7]](./Figures/bod12665_2407.png){height=50%}

## Market Timing


### Market timing is shifting funds between a risky portfolio and a safe asset, depending on expected returns {.allowframebreaks}

![Characteristic lines. *Panel A:* No market timing, beta is constant. *Panel B:* Market timing, beta increases with expected market excess return. *Panel C:* Market timing with only two values of beta. [@bodie_investments_2023, Figure 24.8]](./Figures/bod12665_2408.png){height=50%}

- Tryenor and Mazuy estimate this regression:
$$
r_p - r_f = a + b(r_M -r_f) + c(r_M - r_f)^2 + e_p
$$
- Henriksson and Merton estimate this regression:
$$
r_p - r_f = a + b(r_M -r_f) + c(r_M - r_f)D + e_p
$$
where $D=1$ if $r_M>r_f$ else $D=0$, so portfolio beta is $b$ in bear markets and $b+c$ in bull markets
- A $c>0$ indicates market-timing ability for both models, but neither model has found evidence of market-timing ability among managers

### What is the potential of perfect market timing?^[Performance of bills, equities, and perfect (annual) market timers. Initial investment = $1 (December 31, 1926 to December 31, 2021)]

|  | **Bills** | **Equities** | **Perfect Timer** |
| :---- | --: | --: | --: |
| Terminal value | $21 | $10,546  | $15,12,355  |
| Arithmetic average | 3.31% | 11.96% | 16.72% |
| Standard deviation | 3.12% | 19.89% | 13.34% |
| Geometric average | 3.26% | 10.24% | 16.16% |
| Maximum | 14.71% | 57.35% | 57.35% |
| Minimum | −0.02% | −44.04% | 0.00% |
| Skew | 1.08 | −0.45 | 0.69 |
| Kurtosis | 1.09 | 0.11 | −0.14 |
| LPSD | 0 | 12.80% | 0 |


### Perfect market-timing ability is a call option on market returns {.allowframebreaks}

![Rate of return of a perfect market timer as function of the rate of return on the market index [@bodie_investments_2023, Figure 24.9]](./Figures/bod12665_2409.png){height=50%}

| | $S_T < X$ | $S_T \geq X$ |
|:-- | :-: | :-: |
| Bills | $S_0(1+r_f)$ | $S_0(1+r_f)$ |
| Call | $0$ | $S_T-X$ |
| **Total** | $S_0(1+r_f)$ | $S_T$ |

- The table on the previous slide gives the payoff of this call option
- $X$ is the strike price, and $X=S_0(1+r_f)$
- The value of this perfect market-timing call option is $C = 7.92\%$ of the equity portfolio value
- The value of imperfect market timing is $(P_1+P_2-1)\times C$ where:
  - $P_1$ is the proportion of correct forecasts of bull markets
  - $P_2$ is the proportion of correct forecasts of bear markets


## Performance Attribution Procedures

### Performance attribution decomposes overall performance into discrete components {.allowframebreaks}

- One common attribution approach decomposes performance into three components:
	1. Broad asset allocation choices across equity, fixed-income, and money markets
	1. Industry (sector) choice within each market
	1. Security choice within each sector
- This attribution approach explains the difference between a managed portfolio $P$ and a benchmark portfolio $B$
	- Portfolio $B$, or **bogey**, measures the returns on a completely passive strategy, removing *asset allocation* and *security selection* decisions
	- Therefore, asset allocation and security selection explain all differences between portfolios $P$ and $B$
