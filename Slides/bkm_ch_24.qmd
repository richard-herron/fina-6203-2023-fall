title: Chapter 24 - Portfolio Performance Evaluation
---

<!-- ### Overview

If markets are efficient, investors must be able to measure performance of their asset managers.

Discuss methods to evaluate investment performance.

Conventional approaches to risk adjustment.

### Time-Weighted Returns

__Time-weighted average__

Geometric average is a time-weighted average.

Each period’s return has equal weight.

### Dollar-Weighted Returns 1

__Dollar-weighted rate of return __ is the internal rate of return on an investment.

Returns are weighted by the amount invested in each period.

### Time-Weighted and Dollar-Weighted Returns: Example 1

A stock sells for $50. You purchase one share today and one more in one year. At the end of the second year, you sell both shares for $54. Dividends of $2 per share are paid annually at the end of each year (but before shares are sold).

| Time | Outlay |
| :-: | :-: |
| 0 | $50 to purchase first share |
| 1 | $53 to purchase second share a year later |
|  | Proceeds |
| 1 | $2 dividend from initially purchased share |
| 2 | $4 dividend from the 2 shares held in the second year, plus |
|  | $108 received from selling both shares at $54 each |

The  __time-weighted__  (geometric average) return is 7.81%:

The  __dollar-weighted__  (I R R) return is 7.12%:

### Adjusting Returns for Risk

Simplest and most popular way to adjust for risk is to compare rates of return with those of other investment funds with similar risk characteristics.

__Comparison universe __ is the set of money managers employing similar investment styles, used for assessing the relative performance of a portfolio manager.

### Risk-Adjusted Performance: Sharpe

__Sharpe’s ratio __ divides average portfolio excess return over the sample period by the standard deviation of returns over that period.

Measures reward to (total) volatility trade-off:

### Risk-Adjusted Performance: Treynor

__Treynor’s measure __ is a ratio of excess return to beta, like the Sharpe ratio, but it uses systematic risk instead of total risk.

### Figure 24.3 Treynor Measures of Two Portfolio and the Market Index

|  | Risk-free Asset | Portfolio Q | Portfolio U | Market Index, M |
| :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: |
| Beta | 0 | 1.3 | 0.8 | 1.0 |
| Average return | 6 | 22.0 | 17.0 | 16.0 |
| Excess return (%) | 0 | 16.0 | 11.0 | 10.0 |
| Alpha (%) | 0 | 3.5 | 3.0 | 0.0 |

### Risk-Adjusted Performance: Jensen

__Jensen’s alpha __ is the average return on the portfolio over and above that predicted by the C A P M, given the portfolio’s beta and the average market return.

### Risk-Adjusted Performance: Information Ratio

__Information ratio __ divides the alpha of the portfolio by the nonsystematic risk of the portfolio, called “tracking error” in the industry.

Measures abnormal return per unit of risk that in principle could be diversified away by holding a market index portfolio.

### M Squared Measure and the Shape Ratio

Focuses on total volatility as a measure of risk, but its risk adjustment leads to an easy-to-interpret differential return relative to the benchmark index.

### Figure 24.2 The M Squared of Portfolio P

of Portfolio  _P _ is negative even though its average return

was greater than that of the market index,  _M._

### The Role of Alpha in Performance Measures

* A positive alpha is necessary to outperform the passive market index
  * Though necessary, it’s not enough to guarantee a portfolio will outperform the index.

Most widely used performance measure

|  |  |  |  |
| :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: |
|  |  |  |  |
|  |  |  |  |

denotes the correlation coefficient between portfolio P and the market, and is less than 1.

### Table 24.3 Performance Statistics: Example

|  |  |  |  |
|  |  |  |  |
|  |  |  |  |

### Interpretation of Performance Statistics

If P or Q represents the entire investment, Q is better

because of its higher Sharpe measure and better

If P and Q are potential sub-portfolios, Q also dominates because its Treynor measure is higher.

If we seek an active portfolio to mix with an index portfolio, P is better due to its higher information ratio.

### Realized Returns versus Expected Returns

* Must determine “significance level” of a performance measure to know whether it reliably indicates ability
  * To estimate the portfolio alpha from the S C L, regress portfolio excess returns on the market index.
  * Then, to assess whether the alpha estimate reflects true skill and not just luck, compute the  _t_ -statistic of the alpha estimate.

Even moderate levels of statistical noise make performance evaluation extremely difficult.

### Survivorship Bias and Portfolio Evaluation

Regardless of the performance criterion, some funds will outperform their benchmarks in any year, and some will underperform.

Performance in one period is not predictive of future performance.

Limiting a sample of funds to those for which returns are available over an entire sample period introduces  __survivorship bias.__

### Style Analysis

* _Style analysis _ measures the exposures of managed portfolios to asset classes.
* Introduced by William Sharpe.
  * Regress fund returns on indexes representing a range of asset classes.
  * Regression coefficient on each index would then measure the fund’s implicit allocation to that “style”.

of regression would measure percentage of return variability

    * attributable to style choice rather than security selection.
    * Intercept measures average return from security selection of the fund portfolio.

### Table 24.4 Style Analysis for Fidelity’s Magellan Fund

| Style Portfolio | Regression Coefficient |
| :-: | :-: |
| T-bill | 0 |
| Small cap | 0 |
| Medium cap | 35 |
| Large cap | 61 |
| High P/E (growth) | 5 |
| Medium P/E | 0 |
| Low P/E (value) | 0 |

### Performance Measurement with Changing Portfolio Composition

* Risk-adjustment techniques assume constant portfolio risk, which isn’t necessarily true.
* Performance Manipulation and the M R A R.
  * Managers may try to game the system, given their compensation depends on performance.
  * Only measure impossible to manipulate is M R A R.

Performance of bills, equities, and perfect (annual) market timers. Initial investment = $1 (December 31, 19 26 to December 31, 2021)

*A negative rate on 'bills" was observed in 19 40. The Treasury security used in the data series in these early years was actually not a T-bill but a T-bond with 30 days to maturity.

### Valuing Market Timing as a Call Option

Key to valuing market timing ability is to recognize that perfect foresight is equivalent to holding a call option on the equity portfolio – but without having to pay for it!

### Performance Attribution Procedures 1

* Performance attribution studies attempt to decompose overall performance into discrete components that may be identified with a particular level of the portfolio selection process.
* A common attribution system decomposes performance into three components:
  * Broad asset allocation choices across equity, fixed-income, and money markets.
  * Industry (sector) choice within each market.
  * Security choice within each sector.

* __Bogey__  is designed to measure the returns the portfolio manager would earn if he or she were to follow a completely passive strategy.
  * In this context, “passive” has two attributes.

    * It means the allocation of funds across broad asset classes is set in accord with a notion of “usual” allocation across sectors.
    * It means that  _within_  each asset class, the portfolio manager holds an indexed portfolio.

### Asset Allocation Decisions

* Superior performance relative to the bogey is achieved by:
  * Overweighting investments in markets that turn out to perform well.
  * Underweighting investments in poorly performing markets.

Contribution of asset allocation to superior performance equals the sum over all markets of the excess weight in each market times the return of the index for each market.

### Table 24.6 Performance of the Managed Portfolio

| Component | Bogey Performance and Excess Return: Benchmark Weight | Bogey Performance and Excess Return: Return of Index during Month (%) |
| :-: | :-: | :-: |
| Equity (S&P 500) | 0.60 | 5.81 |

| b. Fixed-Income excess return | 44 × 0.07 (portfolio weight) = | 3.1 |

Good performance (a positive contribution) derives from overweighting well-performing sectors.

Good performance also derives from underweighting poorly performing sectors.
