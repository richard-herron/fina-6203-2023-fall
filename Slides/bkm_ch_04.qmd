## Investment Companies

### Investment companies are financial intermediaries that collect funds from individual investors

- Investment companies perform several important functions
	1. Record keeping and administration
	1. Diversification and divisibility
	1. Professional management
	1. Lower transaction costs
- The value of each share in an investment company is called the *net asset value* (NAV) where
$$
\text{Net asset value} = \frac{\text{Market value of assets} - \text{Liabilities}}{\text{Shares outstanding}}
$$

## Types of Investment Companies

### Unit investment trusts are pools of money invested in a portfolio that is fixed for the life of the fund

- Sponsor buys securities, deposits them into a trust, then sells shares in the trust called *redeemable trust certificates*
- The fund's trustees pay out all income to shareholders
- Portfolio composition is fixed, so there is little active management, and these trusts are often called *unmanaged*
- Sponsors earn profits by selling shares at a premium to NAV
- Investors may sell their shares back to the trust at NAV
- Unmanaged funds have steadily lost market share to managed funds over the past few decades

### There are two types of managed funds: Closed-end and open-end

- Shareholders elect a board of directors, who then hire a management company
- Management fees range from 0.2% to 1.25% of assets
- For example, Fidelity Management and Research Corporation sponsors many Fidelity mutual funds and is responsible for managing the portfolios

### Open-end and closed-end funds have different structures

- Open-end funds are ready to redeem or issue shares at NAV
- In contrast, closed-end funds do not redeem or issue shares
- Instead, investors trade shares on stock exchanges like any other stock

### Closed-end fund prices may trade at a premium or discount to NAV

### Exchange-traded funds (ETFs) combine features of open-end and closed-end funds

- Like open-end funds, ETFs issue and redeem shares NAV
- Like closed-end funds, ETFs trade on stock exchanges and may trade at a premium or discount to NAV
- Since 1993, unmanaged ETFs have tracked indexes, providing exposure to particular markets or sectors
- Since 2008, managed ETFs have been available
- ETFs have gained popularity due to their low costs and flexibility for investors

### Other investment companies include commingled funds, real estate investment trusts (REITs), and hedge funds

- Commingled funds are partnerships of investors that pool funds, similar to open-end funds
- REITs
	- Similar to closed-end funds and invest in real estate or loans secured by real estate
	- Most are highly levered, with typical debt-to-assets ratios of 70%
	- *Equity trusts* invest in real estate directly
	- *Mortgage trusts* invest in mortgages and construction loans
- Hedge funds
	- Private investment partnerships that are typically open only to accredited investors
	- Hedge funds have more flexibility in investment strategies and can use leverage and derivatives
	- Hedge funds often charge a performance fee based on the fund's returns

## Mutual Funds

### Mutual funds are the common name for open-end funds and account for about 80% of investment company assets

- Each mutual fund has a specified investment policy
- Management companies often manage a family of mutual funds, making it easy for investors to allocate across market sectors and move assets across funds while benefiting from centralized record keeping

### Mutual funds are commonly classified by investment policy

- Money market funds
- Equity funds
- Sector funds
- Bond funds
- International funds
- Balanced funds,
- Asset allocation and flexible funds
- Index funds

### Money market funds invest in money market securities, such as Treasury bills, commercial paper, repurchase agreements, and CDs

- Average maturity of these investments is about one month
- These funds usually offer check-writing features and fix NAV at one dollar per share, removing tax implications of redemptions
- Money market funds are classified as *prime* versus *government*
	- Prime funds hold commercial paper or bank CDs
	- Government funds hold short-term U.S. Treasury or agency securities

### Equity funds invest primarily in stock but may also hold fixed-income or other types of securities

- For example, equity funds typically hold a small fraction of assets in money market securities to provide liquidity to meet share redemptions
- Stock funds are traditionally classified by their emphasis on *capital appreciation* versus *current income*
	- *Income funds* hold shares of firms with consistently high dividend yields
	- *Growth funds* focus on prospects for capital gains and are typically riskier than income funds

### *Sector funds* focus on an industry or country

- For example, Fidelity has many "select funds" that invest in a specific industry, such as biotechnology, utilities, energy, or telecommunications

### Bonds funds specialize in the fixed-income sector

- The fixed-income sector offers room for further specialization!
- Specialization includes corporate bonds, Treasury bonds, mortgage-backed securities, and (tax-free) municipal bonds
- Some municipal bond funds invest only in bonds of a particular state or city!
- Other funds specialize by maturity or credit risk

### International funds invest outside the U.S.

- Global funds invest in securities worldwide, including the U.S.
- International funds invest in securities of firms located outside the U.S.
- Regional funds invest in a particular part of the world
- Emerging market funds invest in companies of developing nations

### Balanced funds are designed to be an individual’s entire investment portfolio

- Balanced funds hold equities and fixed-income securities in stable proportions
- Life-cycle funds are balanced funds in which the asset mix can range from aggressive (primarily marketed to younger investors) to conservative
(directed at older investors)
	- Static allocation life-cycle funds maintain a stable mix across stocks and bonds
	- Targeted-maturity funds gradually become more conservative as the investor ages
- Many balanced funds are *funds of funds* that invest in shares of other mutual funds

### Asset allocation and flexible funds hold stocks and bonds but may vary their proportions

- The proportions vary based on the portfolio manager’s forecast of the relative performance 
- Therefore, these funds are engaged in market timing and are not designed to be low-risk (or low-fee) investments

### Index funds try to match the performance of a broad market index

- An index fund buys securities included in a particular index in proportion to each security’s representation in that index
- For example, the Vanguard 500 Index Fund replicates the composition of the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index
- Index funds provide a low-cost way for small investors to pursue a passive investment strategy
- Index funds can be tied to non-equity indexes, too

## Costs of Investing in Mutual Funds

### Mutual fund investors should consider fund investment policy and past performance, as well as management fees and other expenses

- Operating expenses are costs incurred by the mutual fund
- Commission expenses are primarily paid to brokers
	- Front-end loads are commissions paid when you purchase shares
	- Back-end loads are redemption or "exit" fees paid when you sell shares (formally known as "contingent deferred sales loads")
	- 12b-1 charges are fees on 12b-1 funds that cover advertising, reports, and broker commissions
	- Alternatively, investors may hire fee-only financial managers who charge directly for services instead of collecting commissions

### The mutual fund rate of return is the change in NAV plus income and capital gains distributions, expressed as a fraction of the beginning NAV

$$
\text{Rate of return} = \frac{\text{NAV}_1 - \text{NAV}_0 + \text{Income and cap.\ gain dist.}}{\text{NAV}_0}
$$

### Fees can have a big effect on performance!

## Taxation of Mutual Fund Income

### Mutual funds have "pass-through status", so investors pay taxes instead funds

- Capital gains and dividends pass through to investors
- This pass-through is a disadvantage
	- If you manage your portfolio, you can time sales to manage taxes
	- However, when you invest through mutual funds, you cannot time individual security sales to manage taxes
- Therefore, mutual funds with high turnover can be "tax inefficient"
	- Turnover is the ratio of the trading activity to assets 
	- Capital gains and losses are constantly realized in high-turnover funds
	- Index funds may have turnover as low as 2%, which is tax-efficient and has low trading costs

## Exchange-Traded Funds

### ETFs let investors trade portfolios just as they trade shares of stock

- The first ETF was the Standard & Poor's Depository Receipt (SPDR), which matches the S&P 500
- ETFs trade throughout the day at the market price, while mutual funds only trade  at the end of the day at NAV
- Starting in 2008, the SEC approved actively managed ETFs, often called *smart beta* funds
- Exchange-traded notes (ETNs) and exchange-traded vehicles (ETVs) provide payoffs linked to indexes but invest in "total return swaps" instead of the underlying assets, providing liquidity to thinly traded (or non-traded) asset classes

### ETFs offer advantages and disadvantages relative to mutual funds

- ETF advantages relative to mutual funds
	- ETFs trade continuously at a market price
	- ETFs are tax efficient because redemptions do not trigger capital gains or losses for other investors
- ETF disadvantages relative to mutual funds
	- ETF prices may depart from NAV
	- ETF purchases may involve a broker commission

## Mutual Fund Investment Performance: A First Look

### The asset-weighted average return on U.S. equity mutual funds was below the Wilshire 5000 index fund in 30 of 50 years between 1971 and 2020
