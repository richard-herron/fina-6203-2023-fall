## Diversification and Portfolio Risk

### There are two broad sources of uncertainty: Market risk and firm-specific risk

- Market risk
  - Attributable to marketwide risk factors
  - Remains after diversification
  - Also called non-diversifiable risk or systematic risk
- Firm-specific risk
  - Eliminated by diversification
  - Also called idiosyncratic risk, diversifiable risk, or nonsystematic risk

### Portfolio risk decreases as we increase the number of (diversified) stocks in the portfolio

![Portfolio risk as a function of the number of stocks in the portfolio. *Panel A:* All risk is firm-specific. *Panel B:* Some risk is systematic, or marketwide [@bodie_investments_2023, Figure 7.1]](./Figures/bod12665_0701.png){height=50%}

### The *insurance principle* reduces risk by spreading exposure across many independent risk sources

- "An insurance company depends on such diversification when it writes many policies insuring against many uncorrelated sources of risk, each policy being a small part of the company's overall portfolio."
- We will revisit this concept later

## Portfolios of Two Risky Assets

### Consider a portfolio of two risky assets

- The return on a portfolio is the weighted average return on its risky assets
$$
r_P = w_D r_D + w_E r_E
$$
where $w$s are weights, $r$s are returns, and subscripts $D$ and $E$ indicate debt and equity
- This portfolio's expected return is
$$
E(r_P) = w_D E(r_D) + w_E E(r_E)
$$
and its variance is
$$
\sigma_P^2 = w_D^2 \sigma_D^2 + w_E^2 \sigma_E^2 + 2 w_D w_E \text{Cov}(r_D, r_E)
$$

### We can rewrite $\sigma_P^2$ as a *border-multiplied* covariance matrix

- $\text{Cov}(r_D, r_D)= \sigma_D^2$
- So we can rewrite
$$
\sigma_P^2 = w_D^2 \sigma_D^2 + w_E^2 \sigma_E^2 + 2 w_D w_E \text{Cov}(r_D, r_E)
$$
as
$$
\sigma_P^2 = w_D^2 \text{Cov}(r_D, r_D) + w_E^2 \text{Cov}(r_E, r_E) + 2 w_D w_E \text{Cov}(r_D, r_E)
$$
which is a *border-multiplied* covariance matrix

### The *border-multiplied* covariance matrix version is easily applied to three or more assets

![Computation of portfolio variance from the covariance matrix [@bodie_investments_2023, Table 7.2]](./Figures/table_0702.png){height=75%}

### We can rewrite $\sigma_P^2$ in terms of correlations

- $\rho_{D,E} = \frac{\text{Cov}(r_D, r_E)}{\sigma_D \sigma_E} \Rightarrow \text{Cov}(r_D, r_E) = \rho_{D,E} \sigma_D \sigma_E$
- So we can rewrite
$$
\sigma_P^2 = w_D^2 \sigma_D^2 + w_E^2 \sigma_E^2 + 2 w_D w_E \text{Cov}(r_D, r_E)
$$
as
$$
\sigma_P^2 = w_D^2 \sigma_D^2 + w_E^2 \sigma_E^2 + 2 w_D w_E \rho_{D,E} \sigma_D \sigma_E
$$

### Correlations fall between -1 and +1 (inclusive), making them easier to interpret than covariances

- When $\rho = 1$
$$
\sigma_P^2 = (w_D \sigma_D + w_E \sigma_E)^2
$$
so $\sigma_P = \text{Absolute value}(w_D \sigma_D + w_E \sigma_E)$
- When $\rho < 1$, we reduce risk through *diversification*
- When $\rho < 0$, we *substantially* reduce risk through *hedging*
- When $\rho = -1$
$$
\sigma_P^2 = (w_D \sigma_D - w_E \sigma_E)^2
$$
so $\sigma_P = 0$ when $w_D \sigma_d - w_E \sigma_E = 0$


### Portfolio expected return is the weighted average of asset expected returns, but the same is *not* true of portfolio standard deviation {.allowframebreaks}

## Asset Allocation with Stocks, Bonds, and Bills

### When allocating capital between risky and risk-free portfolios, investors want the risky portfolio with the highest Sharpe ratio {.allowframebreaks}

- The higher the Sharpe ratio, the higher the expected return corresponding to any level of volatility
- Recall the Sharpe ratio is the slope of the capital allocation line (CAL)
- The steepest CAL intersects that optimal risky portfolio

![The opportunity set of the debt and equity funds and two feasible CALs [@bodie_investments_2023, Figure 7.6]](./Figures/bod12665_0706.png){height=50%}

![The opportunity set of the debt and equity funds with the optimal CAL and the optimal risky portfolio [@bodie_investments_2023, Figure 7.7]](./Figures/bod12665_0707.png){height=50%}

- With two risky assets
$$
E(r_P) = w_D E(r_D) + w_E E(r_E)
$$
and
$$
\sigma_P = \sqrt{w_D^2 \sigma_D^2 + w_E^2 \sigma_E^2 + 2 w_D w_E \text{Cov}(r_D, r_E)}
$$
- The investor solves
$$
\max_{w} S_P = \frac{r_P - r_f}{\sigma_P}\
$$
subject to
$$
w_D + w_E = 1
$$
- The solution to this maximization problem is
$$
w_D = \frac{E(R_D)\sigma_E^2 - E(R_E)\text{Cov}(R_D,R_E)}{E(R_D)\sigma_E^2 + E(R_E)\sigma_D^2 - [E(R_D) + E(R_E)]\text{Cov}(R_D,R_E)}
$$
where $R$s indicate *excess* returns and $w_E=1-w_D$


### The optimal *complete* portfolio, given the optimal *risky* portfolio and its CAL, depends on investor risk aversion

![Determination of the optimal complete portfolio [@bodie_investments_2023, Figure 7.9]](./Figures/bod12665_0708.png){height=50%}

### Putting it all together: How to find the complete portfolio

1. Specify the return characteristics of all securities
2. Establish the risky portfolio (asset allocation)
  - Calculate the optimal risky portfolio $P$
  - Calculate its properties
3. Allocate funds between the risky portfolio and the risk-free asset (capital allocation)
  - Calculate the fraction of the complete portfolio allocated to $P$
  - Calculate the share of the complete portfolio invested in each risky and risk-free asset

## The Markowitz Portfolio Optimization Model

### Markowitz provides a more general solution to finding the complete portfolio

1. Find the risk-return combinations of the risky assets
1. Find the optimal risky portfolio, which has the steepest CAL
1. Find the appropriate complete portfolio by mixing the risk-free asset with the optimal risky portfolio

### The *minimum-variance frontier* of risky assets plots the portfolio with the lowest variance for a given expected return {.allowframebreaks}

![The minimum-variance frontier of risky-assets [@bodie_investments_2023, Figure 7.10]](./Figures/bod12665_0710.png){height=50%}

- All individual risky assets plot inside the minimum-variance frontier (if we allow short sales)
- Therefore, portfolios of one risky asset are inefficient because diversification lets us build portfolios with lower standard deviations
- The bottom portion of the minimum-variance frontier is inefficient because the portfolios directly above it have the same standard deviations but higher expected returns
- The *efficient frontier* of risky assets is the portion of the minimum-variance frontier above the *global minimum-variance portfolio*
- We can find the portfolio expected return as
$$
E(r_P) = \sum_{i=1}^n w_i E(r_i)
$$
and portfolio variance as
$$
\sigma_p^2 = \sum_{i=1}^n \sum_{j=1}^n w_i w_j \text{Cov}(r_i, r_j)
$$
- Therefore, to find the minimum-variance frontier of $n$ risky assets, we need 
  - $n$ forecasts of $E(r_i)$
  - $n$ forecasts of $\text{Var}(r_i)$
  - $\frac{n^2 - n}{2}$ forecasts of $\text{Cov}(r_i, r_j)$

### The CAL with the optimal portfolio *P* is tangent to the efficient frontier {.allowframebreaks}

![The efficient frontier of risky assets with the optimal CAL [@bodie_investments_2023, Figure 7.11]](/Figures/bod12665_0711.png){height=50%}


### All investors choose their appropriate complete portfolios as before

- Recall
$$
y^* = \frac{E(r_P) - r_f}{A \sigma_P^2}
$$
- Here $y^*$ is the optimal weight on the optimal risky portfolio and $A$ is the risk aversion index

### All investors choose the same optimal risky portfolio, *P*, regardless of their risk aversion

- Risk aversion affects capital allocation, which is choosing $y$
- Risk aversion *does not* affect finding the optimal risky portfolio, which is choosing $w_i$s
- This result is a *separation property*, which separates the portfolio choice into two *independent* tasks
  1. Find the optimal risky portfolio, which is the same, regardless of risk aversion
  1. Allocate capital, which depends on risk aversion

### The risk of a highly diversified portfolio depends on the covariance of asset returns {.allowframebreaks}

- Portfolio variance is
$$
\sigma_p^2 = \sum_{i=1}^n \sum_{j=1}^n w_i w_j \text{Cov}(r_i, r_j)
$$
- For an equally-weighted portfolio, portfolio variance is
$$
\sigma_p^2 = \sum_{i=1}^n \frac{1}{n^2} \sigma_i^2 + \sum_{i=1}^n \sum_{\substack{j=1\\ j\neq i}}^n \frac{1}{n^2} \text{Cov}(r_i, r_j)
$$
- We can simplify the variance term as 
$$\overline{\sigma}^2 = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^n \sigma_i^2$$
and the covariance term as
$$\overline{\text{Cov}} = \frac{1}{n(n-1)} \sum_{i=1}^n \sum_{\substack{j=1\\ j\neq i}}^n \text{Cov}(r_i, r_j)$$
- So, for an equally-weighted portfolio, portfolio variance is
$$
\sigma_p^2 = \frac{1}{n} \overline{\sigma}^2 + \frac{n-1}{n} \overline{\text{Cov}}
$$
- These simplifications highlight the importance of the covariance of asset returns
  - If $\overline{\text{Cov}} = 0$, $\sigma_p^2 \rightarrow 0$ as $n \rightarrow \infty$
  - If $\overline{\text{Cov}} > 0$, $\frac{1}{n} \overline{\sigma}^2 \rightarrow 0$ but $\frac{n-1}{n} \overline{\text{Cov}} \rightarrow \overline{\text{Cov}}$ as $n \rightarrow 0$
  - If all assets have standard deviation $\sigma$ and all asset-pairs have correlation $\rho$, we can express portfolio variance as 
  $$
  \sigma_p^2 = \frac{1}{n} \sigma^2 + \frac{n-1}{n} \rho \sigma^2
  $$
  and draw the same conclusions

## Risk Pooling, Risk Sharing, and Time Diversification

### Risk sharing complements risk pooling

- An insurance company that sells $n$ identical fire insurance policies, each with random payoff $x$ with variance $\sigma^2$, has a total payoff of $\sum_{i=1}^n x_i$
- The variance of total payoff increases as $n$ increases because 
$$
\text{Var}\left( \sum_{i=1}^n x_i \right) = n \sigma^2
$$
- However, the variance of the *average* payoff decreases as $n$ increases because 
$$
\text{Var}\left( \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^n x_i \right) = \frac{1}{n^2} n \sigma^2 = \frac{\sigma^2}{n}
$$
- Therefore, true diversification requires allocating a given investment budget across a large number of different assets, limiting exposure to any one asset

### Longer horizons alone do not reduce risk
