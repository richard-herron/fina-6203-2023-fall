## Bond Characteristics

### A bond is a security with a legally binding borrowing arrangement

- The bond issuer (i.e., the borrower) agrees to make specified payments to the bondholder on specified dates
- Par value (or face value) is the payment to the bondholder on the bond's maturity date
- The coupon rate is the bond's interest payment per year per dollar of par value
	- Firms typically split coupon payments into two equal semiannual payments
	- *Firms typically set coupon rates to induce investors to pay par value for a bond at issue* 
- The bond indenture is the contract between the issuer and the bondholder


### Treasury notes and bonds {.allowframebreaks}

- Maturity
	- Treasury notes: 1 to 10 years
	- Treasury bonds: 10 to 30 years
- Investors may purchase notes and bonds directly from the Treasury
- Denominations are as small as $100, but $1,000 is most common

### Investors do not pay the quoted prices for bonds because of accrued interest

- The quoted prices do not include the interest accrued between coupon payment dates
- If a bond trades between coupon payment dates, the buyer must pay the seller for interest accrued since the last coupon payment:
$$
\text{Accrued interest} = \frac{\text{Ann. coupon}}{2} \times \frac{\text{Days since last coupon}}{\text{Days separating coupons}}
$$



### Corporations also borrow money by issuing bonds {.allowframebreaks}


- There are many combinations of issuer, maturity, coupon rate, seniority, etc., often leading to thin markets
- Therefore, most corporate bonds trade over the counter instead of on exchanges

### Some corporate bonds have additional features {.allowframebreaks}

- Call provisions allow issuers to repurchase bonds at a specified *call price* before maturity 
	- Allow firms to call bonds with high coupon rates when interest rates fall
	- The option to call a bond is valuable *to the firm*, so callable bonds typically offer higher coupon rates and promised yields than non-callable bonds
- Convertible bonds give holders the option to exchange each bond for a specified number of shares of the firm's stock
	- The option to convert a bond is valuable *to the bondholder*, so convertible bonds typically offer lower coupon rates and yields to maturity than non-convertible bonds
- Put bonds give the holder the option to exchange the bond for par value at some date or to extend it for a given number of years
	- If a bond's coupon rate is greater than current market yields, the bondholder will extend the bond's life
	- If a bond's coupon rate is lower than current market yields, the bondholder will retire the bonds and collect its principal
- Floating-rate bonds pay interest rates that are reset periodically according to a specified market rate


### Preferred stock is a hybrid security that is part equity, part bond

- Preferred stock is considered equity but often included in the fixed-income universe
- Like bonds
	- Promises to pay a specified cash flow stream
	- Commonly pays a fixed dividend
	- Rarely gives holders full voting privileges
- Unlike bonds
	- Failure to pay the promised dividend does not result in corporate bankruptcy
	- Dividends owed typically cumulate


### International bonds are issued in one country by a borrower from a different country 

- Issuers denominate *foreign bonds* in the currency of the country where issued
	- Samurai bonds
	- Bulldog bonds
- Issuers denominate *Eurobonds* in a currency *other than* the country where issued, typically the issuer's home currency
	- Euro-yen bonds
	- Euro-sterling bonds


### Bond issuers often develop bonds with unusual features

- Most bonds have maturities of 30 years or less
- However, some have maturities between 50 and 100 years
- Inverse floaters are like floating-rate bonds, except coupon rate *falls*  when the general level of interest rates *rises*
- Asset-backed bonds use income from a specified group of assets to service the debt
- Catastrophe bond final payments depend on whether there has been a specified catastrophe, allowing the issuer to transfer catastrophe risk to the market
- Indexed bonds make payments tied to a general price index or the price of a commodity (e.g., Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities or TIPS)


## Bond Pricing

### Bond value is the present value of all payments

$$
\text{Bond value} = \sum_{t=1}^T \frac{\text{Coupon}}{(1+r)^t} + \frac{\text{Par value}}{(1+r)^T}
$$

- The first term on the right-hand side of the equation is the present value of an annuity
- The second term is the present value of a single amount, the final payment of the bond's par value


### There is an inverse relation between bond values and interest rates {.allowframebreaks}

### Quoted bond prices do not include interest that accrues between coupon payments

- The buyer pays the seller for accrued interest, which is the prorated share of the upcoming semiannual coupon:
$$
\text{Accrued interest} = \frac{\text{Ann. coupon}}{2} \times \frac{\text{Days since last coupon}}{\text{Days separating coupons}}
$$
- The sale price (invoice price) of the bond equals the stated price (flat price) plus the accrued interest:
$$
\text{Invoice price} = \text{Flat price} + \text{Accrued interest}
$$

## Bond Yields

### Yield to maturity (YTM) is the interest rate that equates the present value of bond payments and market price

- We often interpret the YTM as the average rate of return that we earn if we buy the bond and hold it until maturity
- The inverse relation between price and yield is a central feature of fixed-income securities
- Interest rate fluctuations are the main source of risk in the fixed-income market
- The price curve is convex and flattens at higher interest rates
- The longer the maturity of the bond, the more sensitive its price is to changes in market interest rates


### YTM and current yield are different

- Yield to maturity (YTM)
	- The bond's internal rate of return
	- The compound rate of return over the life of the bond, assuming the bond holder reinvests all coupon payments at the YTM
	- Proxy for the average return
- Current yield
	- The bond's annual coupon payment divided by its price
	- Premium bonds:  $\text{Coupon rate} > \text{Current yield} > \text{YTM}$
	- Discount bonds:  $\text{Coupon rate} < \text{Current yield} < \text{YTM}$


### YTM and yield to call (YTC) are different {.allowframebreaks}

- YTC is similar to YTM except:
	- The time until *call* replaces the time until *maturity*
	- The call price replaces the par value
- At *low* interest rates: The price of the callable bond is flat since the risk of a repurchase or call is high
- At *high* interest rates: The price of the callable bond converges to that of a normal bond since the risk of a call is negligible

### YTM and realized compound return are different {.allowframebreaks}

- YTM will equal the rate of return realized over the life of the bond if all coupons are reinvested and earn the YTM
- Realized compound return is the compound rate of return assuming that coupon payments are reinvested at market rates until maturity 
- Forecasting the realized compound yield over various holding periods or investment horizons is *horizon analysis*
- As interest rates change, bond investors face two offsetting risks
	1. Price risk: When rates rise, bond prices fall
	1. Reinvestment rate risk: When rates rise, reinvestment rates rise
- Chapter 16 discusses how bond investors manage these risks

## Bond Prices over Time

### The relative values of coupon rates and YTMs are useful {.allowframebreaks}

- A bond sells at par value when its coupon rate equals its YTM
	- Here, the coupon payments exactly compensate for the time value of money
- A bond sells at *a discount* to par value when its coupon rate is *less than* its YTM 
	- Here, the coupon payments do not compensate for the time value of money, so investors require additional capital gains
- A bond sells at *a premium* to par value when its coupon rate is *greater than* its YTM 
	- Here, the coupon payments more than compensate for the time value of money, so investors pay more than the par value

\framebreak

### YTM and holding period return (HPR) are different

- HPR 
	- The rate of return over a particular investment period
	- Depends on the bond's price at the end of the holding period, which is an unknown future value
- YTM
	- The average rate of return if the bond is held to maturity
	- Depends on coupon rate, maturity, and par value, which are all known
- When YTM does not change over a period $\text{YTM}=\text{HPR}$

<!-- TODO: add questions where small changes in YTM create large changes in HPR -->


### Zero-coupon bonds sell at a discount and pay interest as capital gains

## Default Risk and Bond Pricing

### Bonds *promise* a fixed flow of income, which is not guaranteed unless the issuer cannot default

- Credit risk, or default risk, is the risk the bond will not make all promised payments
- Rating companies: Moody's Investor Service, Standard & Poor's, and Fitch Ratings
- Rating categories
	- Highest rating is AAA (or Aaa)
	- Investment grade bonds are rated BBB/Baa or above
	- Speculative-grade or junk bonds are rated below BBB/Baa


### Definitions of each bond rating class

![Definitions of each bond rating class [@bodie_investments_2023, Figure 14.8]](./Figures/bod12665_1408.png){height=50%}


### Bond rating agencies analyze the levels and trends of issuer financial ratios 

![Financial ratios by rating class [@bodie_investments_2023, Table 14.3]](./Figures/table_1403.png){height=50%}


### Financial ratios predict bankruptcy {.allowframebreaks}

- We calculate a $Z$ score based on firm financial characteristics:
$$
Z=3.1\frac{EBIT}{A} + 1.0\frac{Sales}{A} + 0.42\frac{E}{L} + 0.85\frac{RE}{A} + 0.72\frac{WC}{A}
$$
- Higher $Z$ scores indicate lower credit risk
	- $Z < 1.23$ indicates vulnerability to bankruptcy
	- $1.23 \leq Z < 2.90$ is a gray area
	- $2.90 \leq Z$ indicates safety

### The bond indenture is the contract between the issuer and bondholders

- Sinking funds call for the issuer to periodically repurchase some proportion of the outstanding bonds before maturity
- The subordination clause restricts the amount of additional borrowing by the firm
- Dividend restrictions limit the payment of dividends by firms (e.g., cumulative dividends cannot exceed cumulative retained earnings)
- Collateral is a particular asset that the bondholders receive if the firm defaults, making collateralized bonds generally safer than debenture bonds


### *Promised* YTM and *expected* YTM are different {.allowframebreaks}

- Promised YTM will only be realized if the firm meets the obligations of the bond issue
- Expected YTM must consider the possibility of a default
- Default premium (also known as a credit spread) is the difference between the promised YTM on a corporate bond and the YTM on an otherwise-identical government bond that is default risk-free

### Credit default swaps (CDSs) insure a bond or loan against default

- Allows lenders to insure against default
- The risk structure of interest rates and CDS prices ought to be tightly aligned
- CDS contracts trade on corporate and sovereign debt
- Natural CDS buyers are large bondholders that want to enhance the creditworthiness of their outstanding loans
- CDS buyers can also use them to speculate on the financial health of an issuer


### Collateralized debt obligations (CDOs) reallocate credit risk {.allowframebreaks}

- A structured Investment Vehicle (SIV) is a legally distinct entity that buys debt and resells it as a portfolio
- Loans are pooled together and split into  _tranches_
- Each tranche is given a different level of seniority to claims on the underlying loan pool
- Mortgage-backed CDOs were an investment disaster during 2007 to 2009
