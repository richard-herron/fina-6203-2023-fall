title: Chapter 3 - How Securities Are Traded

## How Firms Issue Securities

### Firms raise funds by borrowing money or selling ownership shares

- Primary market: Offers new securities to the public, and funds flow from buyers to firms
- Secondary market: Trades existing securities, and funds flow from buyers to sellers

### Privately held firms: A small number of managers and investors hold all shares, which do not trade in public markets

- Pros
	- Firms have weaker obligations to disclose information to the public than do public firms
	- Less disclosure saves money, avoids revealing secrets to competitors, and may help private firms pursue long-term goals without the pressure of quarterly earnings announcements
	- Security and Exchange (SEC) Rule 144A private placements avoid lengthy and costly registration statements
- Cons
	- Private placements do not trade in public markets, reducing their liquidity and valuations
	- Previously limited to 499 shareholders, but the JOBS Act of 2012 increased this limit to 1999 shareholders

### Liquidity is the ability to trade an asset at a fair price in the desired quantity and time

- Liquid stocks can be traded in large volumes on short notice without substantially changing their prices
- Illiquid stocks may be difficult to buy or sell without causing price volatility

### Publicly-traded companies: Shares continually trade in public markets among diverse investors

- Initial public offering (IPO): First sale of shares to the general public
- Seasoned equity offering (SEO): Sale of additional shares in an already-publicly-traded firm 
- Syndicates of investment bankers, in their roles as underwriters, typically market public offerings of stocks and bonds
	- Advise firms on the terms of the offering
	- Register the offering with the SEC; the final, accepted registration is called a prospectus
	- In firm-commitment underwriting, investment bankers purchase all securities at a discount, which compensates the underwriters and eliminates the risk for the firm

### "Shelf registrations" let public firms issue securities on short notice with little additional paperwork

- SEC Rule 415 for seasoned offerings lets already publicly traded firms register securities and gradually sell them to the public over the next three years
- These securities are "on the shelf" and ready for issue
- Shelf registrations let public firms sell securities in small amounts on short notice with little additional paperwork and low flotation costs

### IPOs are a lengthy process for underwriters, who typically bear the risk

- Register security with SEC, and distribute preliminary prospectus to potential investors
- Travel the country to visit potential investors, generating interest and providing information
- Estimate investor demand (i.e., price and quantity) by "book building"
- Allocate security to investors, in part based on their expressed interest

### IPOs are often underpriced compared to their market prices

- However, some IPO prices are too high and do not fully sell
- Underwriters bear this risk in firm commitment underwriting

## How Securities Are Traded

### There are four broad types of markets: Direct-search, brokered, dealer, and auction

- Direct search markets: Buyers and sellers search for each other directly
	- Characterized by sporadic participation and non-standard goods
	- Examples: Craiglist and newspaper ads
- Brokered markets: Brokers offer search services to connect buyers and sellers
	- Examples: Real estate and interdealer markets
- Dealer markets: Buyers and sellers trade with dealers
	- Dealers maintain inventories and profit from the spread between buy and sell prices
	- Examples: Bond and foreign exchange markets
- Auction markets: Buyers and sellers trade with each other directly
	- Designated market makers (DMM) maintain orderly markets
	- Examples: New York Stock Exchange (NYSE)

### There are two broad types of orders: Market and price-contingent

- Market orders execute immediately at the best available price
	- Buys execute at the lowest ask price
	- Sells execute at the highest bid price
- Price-contingent orders specify the price at which they execute
	- Limit orders specify the desired execution price
		- Buy limit orders specify the maximum price the buyer is willing to pay
		- Sell limit orders specify the minimum price the seller is willing to accept
		- Limit orders may not immediately execute
	- Stop orders become market orders when the price reaches a specified price
		- Buy stop orders become market orders when the price rises to or exceeds the specified price
		- Sell stop orders become market orders when the price falls to or below the specified price

### Limit order books are collections of limit orders waiting to execute

### Investors buy and sell shares via brokers, who execute trades on one of several market types

- Over-the-counter (OTC) dealer markets
	- Security dealers quote prices to buy or sell securities
	- Brokers contact dealers to facilitate trades between buyers and sellers
- Electronic communication networks (ECNs)
	- Participants electronically submit market and limit orders
	- Orders match automatically without broker intervention
	- Offers speed, anonymity, and cost advantages
- Specialist markets (largely replaced by ECNs)
	- Exchanges assign specialists to manage each security
	- Specialists maintain the limit order book, execute trades, provide liquidity, and maintain a fair and orderly market

## The Rise of Electronic Trading

### ECNs are the dominant market type and have steadily increased their share in the U.S. {.allowframebreaks}

- New regulations allowed brokers to compete, broke the hold of dealers on price information, forced market integration, and allowed smaller price increments (tick sizes)
- Technology enabled rapid price comparison and directed trades to markets with the best prices, leading to competition between markets and lower trade execution costs
- The SEC's Regulation National Market System (NMS) facilitated the electronic linkage of exchanges, creating an integrated electronic market
- Trading today is predominantly electronic, especially for stocks, with the share of electronic trading increasing significantly

<!-- ## U.S. Markets

### NYSE and NASDAQ remain the two largest U.S. stock markets...

- New York Stock Exchange (NYSE)
	- Largest U.S. stock exchange by value of listed stocks
	- Merged with Archipelago Exchange, Euronext, and American Stock Exchange (AMEX)
- National Association of Securities Dealers Automated Quotation System (NASDAQ)
	- Largest U.S. stock exchange by number of listed stocks
	- Merged with OMX Group, maintaining NASDAQ Stock Market and other stock markets in Europe
- Electronic Communication Networks (ECNs)
	- Direct Edge, BATS, and NYSE Arca are major ECNs
	- ECNs offer fully automated trading, matching orders immediately
	- Cross-market links allow high-frequency traders to exploit price discrepancies
	- Latency times are crucial, with speed being a competitive factor -->


## New Trading Strategies

### Electronic trading allows unique strategies

- Algorithmic trading uses computer programs to make trading decisions
	- Exploits small price discrepancies
	- Strategies include short-term trend trading and pairs trading
- High-frequency trading is a subset of algorithmic trading based on rapid decision-making
	- Trade-execution times measured in milli- or micro-seconds
	- Strategies include market-making and cross-market arbitrage
- Dark pools are trading venues that provide anonymity
	- Execute large trades without revealing intentions or reporting details
	- Controversial due to market fragmentation and liquidity impact
- Bond trading still occurs primarily in the OTC market among bond dealers

## Globalization of Stock Markets

### U.S. stock markets have about half of the worldwide stock market capitalization, but many markets are international allegiances

## Trading Costs

### Trading costs are both explicit and implicit

- Explicit costs include fees and commissions
	- Full-service brokers provide a wide range of services and advice
	- Discount brokers provide "no-frills" services at lower costs
- Implicit costs include bid-ask spreads and price concessions for large orders
	- Bid-ask spreads compensate for providing liquidity and facing adverse selection
	- Spreads are wider for stocks with smaller market capitalization, lower liquidity, and limited analyst coverage 
	- To trade large orders, buyers and sellers may need to accept less attractive prices

## Buying on Margin

### Investors can access debt financing with "broker’s call loans"

- "Buying on margin" is borrowing part of the purchase price of the stock
- The *margin* is the portion of the purchase price contributed by the investor, where 
$$
\text{Margin} = \frac{\text{Equity in account}}{\text{Value of stock}}
$$
- The *initial margin* requirement is 50%, set by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System
- The *maintenance margin* is the minimum equity that investors must keep in the margin account
- A *margin call* occurs if the margin falls below the maintenance level

<!-- TODO Add several margin problems -->

## Short Sales

### Short sales let an investor profit from security price declines by selling high and *then* buying low 

- Investor borrows a stock from a broker and then sells it, expecting to repurchase it at a lower price
- Short sale proceeds must be kept on account with the broker, per exchange rules
- Investor "covers the short position" by purchasing a share and returning it (plus any dividends paid during the short sale)

### Comparison of cash flows from long and short positions

## Regulation of Securities Markets

### A handful of laws and organizations regulate U.S. securities markets {.allowframebreaks}

- The Securities Act of 1933 mandates disclosure for new issues
- The Securities and Exchange Act of 1934
	- Establishes the SEC to administer the 1933 act
	- Extends the disclosure mandate to existing issues
	- Empowers the SEC to register and regulate
- The Securities Investor Protection Act of 1970 protects investors from brokerage failures
- State laws known as *blue sky laws* give investors clearer views of investments
- The Sarbanes-Oxley Act responds to accounting scandals that occurred from 2000 to 2002
	- Public Company Accounting Oversight Board
	- Independent financial experts must serve on audit committees
	- CEOs and CFOs must personally certify financial reports
	- Auditors cannot provide several other services to clients
	- Boards must have independent directors
- Organizations that *self* regulate
	- Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA)
	- Chartered Financial Analyst (CFA) Institute

### Regulations prohibit trading on inside information

- Officers, directors, and major stockholders must report all transactions in their firm’s stock
- Still, we have evidence that insiders exploit their knowledge
	- Well-publicized convictions of principals in insider trading schemes
	- Considerable evidence of leakage
	- Insider trades earn abnormal returns
