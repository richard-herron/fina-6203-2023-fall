## The Yield Curve

### The yield curve plots yield to maturity as a function of time to maturity {.allowframebreaks}

- The yield curve is central to bond valuation
- It allows investors to gauge their expectations for future interest rates against those of the market

### The yields on different maturity bonds are not equal

- Consider each bond cash flow as a stand-alone zero-coupon bond
- The bond value should be the sum of the values of each bond cash flow
- Bond stripping and bond reconstitution offer arbitrage  opportunities

<!-- TODO: Add a yield curve exercise -->


### In practice, there are two yield curves

- Pure yield curve: Based on stripped or zero-coupon Treasuries
- On-the-Run yield curve: Based on recently issued coupon bonds selling at or near par value
- These yield curves may differ significantly, and the financial press typically prefers the on-the-run yield curve because on-the-run Treasuries are more liquid than zero-coupon Treasuries


## The Yield Curve and Future Interest Rates


### In a world without uncertainty, all investors know all future interest rates {.allowframebreaks}

- Spot rate:
	- The rate that prevails _today_ for a period corresponding to the zero's maturity
	- For example, $y_2$ is the spot rate for the 2-year zero
- Short rate:
	- The rate that applies for a given time interval (e.g., one year)
	- For example, $r_1$ and $r_2$ are the short rates that apply to years 1 and 2, respectively
- By the Law of One Price, the multiyear cumulative returns on competing bonds must be similar:
$$
(1+y_2)^2 = (1+r_1) \times (1+r_2)
$$

![Short rates versus spot rates [@bodie_investments_2023, Figure 15.3]](./Figures/bod12665_1503.png){height=50%}


### We can generalize the relation between spot and short rates

- For any maturity $n$, the relation between spot rates for $n-1$ and $n$ and short rates in year $n$ is:
$$
(1+y_n)^n = (1+y_{n-1})^{n-1} \times (1+r_n)
$$
- Therefore:
$$
1+r_n = \frac{(1+y_n)^2}{(1+y_{n-1})^{n-1}}
$$

### In our world with uncertainty, future short rates are uncertain

- The forward interest rate $f_n$ is a forecast of a future short rate $r_n$
- Therefore:
$$
1+f_n = \frac{(1+y_n)^2}{(1+y_{n-1})^{n-1}}
$$
- The forward rate is the "break-even" interest rate that equates the return on an $n$-period zero-coupon bond to that of an $(n-1)$-period zero-coupon bond rolling over into a 1-year bond in year $n$
- *When we get to year $n$, we may find $r_n \neq f_n$*


## Interest Rate Uncertainty and Forward Rates

### The term structure is harder to interpret when future interest rates are uncertain

- A one-year investor requires a *liquidity premium* to buy the two-year bond instead of the one-year bond because she faces price rIsk when she sells the two-year bond in one year
- Conversely, a two-year investor requires a liquidity premium to buy the one-year bond instead of the two-year because she faces rate uncertainty when she rolls over from the first one-year bond to the second one-year bond


## Theories of the Term Structure

### Expectations hypothesis theory: Forward rate equals the consensus expectation of the future short rate

- The simplest theory of the term structure
- If the forward rate equals the market consensus expectation of future short interest rate
- Then $f_2 = E(r_2)$ and liquidity premiums are zero
- Therefore, the yields on long-term bonds depend only on expectations of future short rates so
$$
(1+y_2)^2 = (1+r_1) \times [1+E(r_n)]
$$
and an upward-sloping yield curve indicates that investors expect interest rates to increase


### Liquidity preference theory: Short-term investors determine market prices, so the liquidity premium is generally positive {.allowframebreaks}

- Long-term bonds are more risky than short-term bonds for short-term investors because long-term bonds have short-term price risk
- Therefore, short-term investors require a positive *liquidity premium* to bear this price risk
- The liquidity premium is $f_2 - E(r_2)$, so liquidity preference theory predicts $f_2 > E(r_2)$ and an upward-sloping yield curve indicates the liquidity premium

### Market segmentation theory: Long-maturity and short-maturity bonds trade in segmented markets

- Each segmented market finds its equilibrium independently
- These segmented markets determine the yield curve
- This theory is less common today:
  - Investors must compare long and short rates as well as expectations of future rates before deciding where to invest
  - If the liquidity premium were too positive or too negative, investors would rush to the same segment

## Interpreting the Term Structure

### Yield curve reflects expectations of future short rates and other factors, such as liquidity premiums {.allowframebreaks}

- When future rates are uncertain:
$$
1+y_n = [(1+r_1)(1+f_2)(1+f_3)\cdots(1+f_n)]^{1/n}
$$
so $f_{n+1} > y_n$ for an upward-sloping yield curve
- An upward-sloping yield curve has two interpretations:
  - Investors expect rates to rise (i.e., $E(r_n)$ is high) ***and/or***
  - Investors require large liquidity premiums to hold long-term bonds (i.e., $f_n = E(r_n) + \underbrace{\text{Liquidity premium}}_{> 0}$)
- The yield curve is a good predictor of the business cycle
  - An upward-sloping yield curve may indicate expansion when long-term rates tend to rise
  - An inverted yield curve may indicate recession when interest rates tend to fall

## Forward Rates as Forward Contracts


### We can derive forward rates from the yield curve

- However:
  - Forward rates will not equal the eventually realized short rate
  - Nor are forward rates even today's expectation of what the short rate will be
- Still, the forward rate is a market rate and an important consideration when making decisions, such as locking in loan rates
