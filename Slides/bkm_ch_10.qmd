## Multifactor Models: A Preview


### We can decompose stock variability into two sources: market and firm-specific

- Market risk is also known as systematic risk or non-diversifiable risk
- Firm-specific risk is also known as non-systematic risk, diversifiable risk, or idiosyncratic risk
- However, risk premiums may depend on correlations with extra-market risk factors (e.g., inflation, interest rates, and volatility)

### *Single-factor*  models allow two sources of uncertainty in asset returns

- These two sources of uncertainty in asset returns are
  - Common or macroeconomic surprises
  - Firm-specific surprises
- *Single-factor* models of excess returns have the form
$$
R_i = E(R_i) + \beta_i F + e_i
$$
where 
  - $R_i$ is the realized excess return on stock $i$
  - $E(R_i)$ is the expected excess return on stock $i$
  - $\beta_i$ is the sensitivity of stock $i$ to factor $F$
  - $F$ is the *deviation* of the common factor from its expected value
  - $e_i$ is the firm-specific surprise, which is uncorrelated with $F$
- If $F=0$ (i.e., no macroeconomic surprises), then $R_i = E(R_i) + e_i$ so the return on stock $i$ is its expected return plus the firm-specific surprise


### *Multifactor* models can better describe uncertainty in asset returns by allowing two or more systematic risk factors, as well as firm-specific surprises

- BKM propose a two-factor model where the systematic risk factors are 
  - Unexpected growth in gross domestic product (GDP)
  - Unexpected changes in interest rates (IR)
- This two-factor model has the form:
$$
R_i = E(R_i) + \beta_{i\text{GDP}} \text{GDP} + \beta_{i\text{IR}} \text{IR} + e_i
$$
- We often call $\beta_{i\text{GDP}}$ and $\beta_{i\text{IR}}$ the *factor loadings* or *factor betas* on GDP and IR, respectively
- GDP increases are typically good news to asset returns, so we expect $\beta_{i\text{GDP}} > 0$
- However, interest rate increases are typically bad news for asset returns, so we expect $\beta_{i\text{IR}} < 0$
- Multifactor models can better capture different responses to different sources of macroeconomic uncertainty


## Arbitrage Pricing Theory

### Stephen Ross's arbitrage pricing theory (APT) predicts a security market line (SML) that links expected returns to risk...

- But the APT takes a different path to this SML than the capital asset pricing model (CAPM)
- The APT relies on three propositions
  1. A factor model can describe security returns
  1. There are sufficient securities to diversify away the idiosyncratic risk
  1. Well-functioning security markets do not allow for the persistence of arbitrage opportunities

###  An arbitrage opportunity exists when an investor can earn riskless profits without making a net investment

- A simple example would be if shares of a stock sold for different prices on two different exchanges
- The *Law of One Price* states that two assets that are the same in all economically relevant aspects should have the same price
- *Arbitrageurs* enforce the Law of One Price
- If they observe a violation, they will engage in *arbitrage activity* by simultaneously buying the cheap asset and selling the expensive asset
- These trades bid up (down) the price where it is low (high) until the arbitrage opportunity goes away

### In a well-diversified portfolio, the firm-specific risk becomes negligible so that only factor risk remains

- Consider the excess return $R_P$ on an $n$-stock portfolio with weights $w_i$ where $\sum_{i=1}^n w_i = 1$
$$
R_P = E(R_P) + \beta_P F + e_P
$$
where $E(R_P) = \sum_{i=1}^n w_i E(R_i)$, $\beta_P = \sum_{i=1}^n w_i \beta_i$, and $e_P = \sum_{i=1}^n e_i$
- There are two uncorrelated random variables on the right-hand side of the equation above, so portfolio variance $\sigma_P^2$ is
$$
\sigma_P^2 = \beta_P^2 \sigma_F^2 + \sigma^2(e_P)
$$
- If this portfolio were equally-weighted, we can rewrite $\sigma^2(e_P)$ as
$$
\sigma^2(e_P) = \sum_{i=1}^n w_i^2 \sigma^2(e_i) = \sum_{i=1}^n \left(\frac{1}{n}\right)^2 \sigma^2(e_i) = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^n \frac{\sigma^2(e_i)}{n} = \frac{1}{n} \overline{\sigma}^2(e_i)
$$
so the non-systematic variance of the portfolio equals the average non-systematic variance of the stocks, divided by $n$
- Therefore, non-systematic variance decreases as $n$ increases, which is the effect of diversification
- For a well-diversified portfolio $e_P$ and $\sigma^2(e_P)$ are effectively zero, and
$$
R_P = E(R_P) + \beta_P F
$$
- *A well-diversified portfolio* is one with each weight small enough that, for practical purposes, the non-systematic variance is negligible

## Only systematic or factor risk should be related to portfolio expected returns

## Risk premiums must be proportional to betas

## APT and CAPM

### The APT serves many of the same functions as the CAPM

- Both the CAPM and APT
  - Arrive at the same SML, which gives benchmarks for rates of return for capital budgeting, security valuation, or investment performance evaluation
  - Highlight the important distinction between non-diversifiable risk, which requires a reward in the form of a risk premium, and diversifiable risk, which does not
- However, there are important differences between the CAPM and APT
  - CAPM
    - Model is based on an inherently unobservable "market" portfolio
    - Provides unequivocal statement on the expected return-beta relationship for all securities
  - APT
    - Built on the foundation of well-diversified portfolios
    - Cannot rule out a violation of the expected return-beta relationship for any particular asset
    - Does not assume investors are mean-variance optimizers
    - Uses an observable market index

## A Multifactor APT

### The APT can be generalized to accommodate multiple sources of risk

- Assume a two-factor model
$$
R_i = E(R_i) + \beta_{i1}F_1 + \beta_{i2}F_2 + e_i
$$
- The benchmark portfolios in the APT are *factor portfolios*, which are well-diversified portfolios constructed to have a beta of 1 on one factor and betas of 0 on the other factors
- We can think of these benchmark portfolios as *tracking portfolios* that track one source of macroeconomic risk and are uncorrelated with other sources of risk

## The Fama-French (FF) Three-Factor Model

### The Fama-French (FF) three-factor model uses firm characteristics to identify sources of systematic risk

- The Fama-French three-factor model is:
$$
R_{it} = \alpha_i + \beta_{iM}R_{Mt} + \beta_{iSMB}\text{SMB}_t + \beta_{iHML}\text{HML}_t + e_{it}
$$
where
  - SMB = small minus big, which is the return of a portfolio of small stocks minus the return on a portfolio of large stocks
  - HML = high minus low, which is the return of a portfolio of stocks with a high book-to-market ratio minus the return on a portfolio of stocks with a low book-to-market ratio
- @fama_common_1993 chose SMB and HML because size (market capitalization) and the book-to-market ratio (book value per share divided by stock price) predict deviations of average stock returns from levels consistent with the CAPM
- SMB and HML are not obvious candidates for risk factors, but @fama_common_1993 argue that they may proxy hard-to-measure fundamental variables

### Estimating and implementing a three-factor SML for U.S. Steel

- The three-factor model predicts an expected return of
$$
E(r_X) = r_f + \beta_{X,M}[E(r_M)-r_f] + \beta_{X,SMB}E(r_{SMB}) + \beta_{X,HML}E(r_{HML})
$$
which is
$$
23.9\% = 2\% + 1.771\times8.8\% + 0.369\times3.0\% + 1.249\times4.2\%
$$
- In contrast, the CAPM predicts an expected return of
$$
E(r_X) = r_f + \beta_{X,M}[E(r_M)-r_f]
$$
which is
$$
19/9\% = 2\% + 2.030\times8.8\%
$$
- Note that we ignore $\alpha$ estimates in both models because we except $\alpha = 0$ for all stocks in equilibrium

### Researchers have added *many*, *many* factors to the FF three-factor model

- The two most widely-accepted additions to the three-factor model are:
  - @carhart_persistence_1997 adds a momentum factor
    - The difference between those that performed well last year and those that performed poorly
    - Often called UMD for "up minus down"
  - @fama_five_2015 add a profitability factor and an investment factor
    - The profitability factor, RMW for "robust minus weak", is the difference in returns between a diversified portfolio with strong versus weak profitability
    - The investment factor, CMA for "conservative minus aggressive", is the difference in returns between a diversified portfolio with low versus high investment
- The overwhelming number of other factors are often called the *factor zoo*
  - Many may be redundant and minor variations on the same theme
  - Many may be spurious and the result of "data snooping"
- *In the end, there should be a limited number of factors portfolios, each of which proxies for a source of systematic risk*


### Multifactor models have two important generalizations

1. Investors should be aware that portfolios have exposure to more than one source of systematic risk, and they should think about how much exposure they want to each factor
1. When they evaluate performance, they should be aware of the risk premium from each factor and consider these when they estimate alphas
- Smart-beta exchange-traded funds (ETFs) are designed to provide exposure to specific characteristics such as value, growth, and volatility
- The most common extra-market risk factors are:
  - The Fama-French five-factor model: Size (SMB), value (HML), profitability (RMW), and investment (CMA)
  - Momentum
  - Volatility, liquidity, and dividend yield
