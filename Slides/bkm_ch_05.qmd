## Measuring Returns over Different Holding Periods

### Holding period return (HPR) is the price increase plus income, all divided by the price paid

We calculate HPR as
$$
\text{HPR} = \frac{\text{Ending price of a share} - \text{Beginning price} + \text{Cash dividend}}{\text{Beginning price}}
$$

### We typically express HPRs as effective annual rates (EARs) to simplify comparisons

- The HPR $r_T$ over $T$ years is:
$$
r_T = (1 + \text{EAR})^T - 1
$$
- Therefore:
$$
\text{EAR} = (1 + r_T)^{1/T} - 1
$$

### Rates on short-term investments are often annualized with simple interest instead of compound interest, called annual percentage rate (APR)

- The relation between EAR and PAR is:
$$
1 + \text{EAR} = \left(1 + \frac{\text{APR}}{n}\right)^n
$$
where $n$ is the number of compounding periods per year
- Therefore:
$$
\text{APR} = n \times [(1 + \text{EAR})^{1/n} - 1]
$$

### If we compound continuously, $n \rightarrow \infty$

The relation between EAR and APR (here $r_{cc}$) becomes
$$
1 + \text{EAR} = \exp(r_{cc})
$$
so
$$
\ln(1 + \text{EAR}) = r_{cc}
$$
where $\ln(\cdot)$ is the natural log

## Interest Rates and Inflation Rates

### The *dollar value* of a bank account grows at the *nominal interest rate*, but its *buying power* grows at the *real interest rate*

$$
1 + r_{real} = \frac{1 + r_{nom}}{1 + i}
$$
where $r_{real}$, $r_{nom}$, and $i$ are the real interest, nominal interest, and inflation rates, so
$$
r_{real} = \frac{r_{nom} - i}{1 + i}
$$
so, if inflation is low,
$$
r_{real} \approx r_{nom} - i
$$

### Inflation is a tax on savings!

- The real after-tax rate is approximately the after-tax nominal rate minus the inflation rate
- Therefore, the after-tax real returns fall by the inflation rate times the tax rate
$$
r_{nom}(1-t)-i = (r_{real}+i)(1-t)-i=r_{real}(1-t)-it
$$

### The Fisher equation predicts that the nominal interest rate should track the (expected) inflation rate, leaving the real rate relatively stable

## Risk and Risk Premiums

### The realized rate of return depends on price changes and dividends paid

- The realized rate of return is the same as the *holding period return* (HPR) above
- We calculate HPR as
$$
\text{HPR} = \frac{\text{Ending price of a share} - \text{Beginning price} + \text{Cash dividend}}{\text{Beginning price}}
$$

### The future is uncertain {.allowframebreaks}

- We perform *scenario analysis* to consider HPRs of various economic scenarios and the probabilities of each scenario
- We measure expected or mean rates of return $E(r)$ as the *probability-weighted average of the rates returns in each scenario*
$$
E(r) = \sum_s p(s)r(s)
$$
where $p(s)$ and $r(s)$ are the probability and HPR of each scenario
- We can measure uncertainty as the variance of returns, which is the average *squared* deviation of actual returns from the mean return
$$
\text{Var}(r) = \sigma^2 = \sum_s p(s) [r(s) - E(r)]^2
$$
- In practice, we use the square root of the variance of returns (i.e., $\sigma = \sqrt{\sigma^2}$), which is the standard deviation of returns and has the same units are our returns (i.e., % instead of %\textsuperscript{2})

<!-- TODO Add return and risk problems -->

### We compare returns on risky investments to the risk-free rate

- The *risk premium* is the difference between the *expected* rate of return and the risk-free rate
- The *excess return* is the difference between the *realized* rate of return and the risk-free rate
- Investors are risk averse and require positive risk premiums to hold risky investments
- *However, after the fact, excess returns may be negative*

### The Sharpe ratio is a reward-to-volatility ratio

- Investors accept risk for the *potential* to earn returns greater than the risk-free rate
- Risk premiums are proportional to the risk of expected excess returns, and we measure risk as the standard deviation of *excess* returns
- The Sharpe ratio is the ratio of the risk premium to the standard deviation of excess returns and is commonly used to evaluate investment manager performance
$$
\text{Sharpe ratio} = \frac{\text{Risk premium}}{\text{SD of excess returns}}
$$
- We multiply the numerator by $T$ and the denominator by $\sqrt{T}$ to annualize the Sharpe ratio (e.g., $T=12$ for monthly returns, and $T=252$ for daily returns)

## The Normal Distribution

### We typically assume that market returns are normally distributed {.allowframebreaks}

![Frequency distribution of monthly rate of return on the broad market index, 1927-2020 [@bodie_investments_2023, Figure 5.3]](Figures/bod12665_0503.png){height=50%}

![The normal distribution with mean 10% and standard deviation 20% [@bodie_investments_2023, Figure 5.4]](Figures/bod12665_0504.png){height=50%}

### This normally-distributed returns assumption is not perfect (e.g., stocks returns cannot be less than -100%), but it has a few advantages

1. Normal distribution is symmetric
1. The return on a portfolio of assets with normally distributed returns is also normally distributed
1. We can fully describe a normal distribution with two parameters: mean and standard deviation
1. We can fully describe the relation between two normal distributions with one parameter: correlation coefficient

## Deviations from Normality and Tail Risk

### Asset returns are negative skewed and fat tailed {.allowframebreaks}

- *Skew* is the average *cubed* deviation from the mean
$$
\text{Skew} = \text{Average} \left[ \frac{(r - \bar{r})^3}{\hat{\sigma}^3} \right] = \frac{1}{T} \sum_{t=1}^T \frac{(r_t - \bar{r})^3}{\hat{\sigma}^3} 
$$
- Negative skew indicates that extremely bad outcomes are more likely than extremely good outcomes
- Negative-skewed distributions are left skewed with left tails that are fatter than right tails
- *When returns are positively skewed, SD overestimates risk; when returns are negatively skewed, SD underestimates risk*

![Normal and skewed distributions (mean = 6%, SD = 17%) [@bodie_investments_2023, Figure 5.5]](Figures/bod12665_0505.png){height=50%}

- *Kurtosis* is the average deviation from the mean *raised to the fourth power*
$$
\text{Kurtosis} = \text{Average} \left[ \frac{(r - \bar{r})^4}{\hat{\sigma}^4} \right] - 3 = \frac{1}{T} \sum_{t=1}^T \frac{(r_t - \bar{r})^4}{\hat{\sigma}^4} - 3 
$$
- Then subtract 3 because the normal distribution has a kurtosis of 3
- Kurtosis raises deviations to the fourth power, so kurtosis is more sensitive to outliers than the variance
- Kurtosis values greater than zero indicate "fat tails," where extreme outcomes are more likely than for normal distributions


![Normal and fat-tailed distributions (mean = 10%, SD = 20%) [@bodie_investments_2023, Figure 5.6]](Figures/bod12665_0506.png){height=50%}

### There are four more common measures of downside risk

1. Value at risk (VaR) is the loss corresponding to a low percentile of the return distribution (e.g., we expect 99% of returns to exceed the 1% VaR )
1. Expected shortfall (ES) is the expected loss given that we find ourselves in a worst-case scenario (e.g., the 1% ES is the average of the worst 1% of all returns)
1. Lower partial standard deviation (LPSD) is the standard deviation of *negative* excess returns, and the Sortino ratio is the ratio of the mean excess return to the LPSD (i.e., the Sharpe ratio but with the LPSD)
1. Relative frequency of large, negative 3-sigma returns calculates the percent of returns that fall 3 standard deviations below the mean

## Learning from Historical Records

### Expected returns and the arithmetic average

- When we do *scenario analysis*, we specify scenarios, each with a probability and return
- When we use *historical data*
	- We treat each observation as an equally likely scenario, so we use an equal probability of $\frac{1}{n}$ for each $p(s)$
	- We estimate expected return $E(r)$ as the arithmetic average of sample returns
	$$
	E(r) = \sum_{s=1}^n p(s)r(s) = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{s=1}^n r(s)
	$$

### Geometric average return versus arithmetic average return

- The *arithmetic* average return is an unbiased estimate of *expected* returns
- The *geometric* average return is an HPR that would compound to the same terminal value as the historical data
$$
\text{Geometric average} = \left[ \prod_{s=1}^n (1+r_s) \right]^{1/n} - 1
$$
- The geometric average return is always less than or equal to the arithmetic average return
- With normally-distributed returns
$$
E[\text{Geometric average}] = E[\text{Arithmetic average}] - \frac{\sigma^2}{2}
$$

### Estimating return variance and standard deviation

- Again, with historical data, we treat each observation as an equally likely scenario, so we use an equal probability of $\frac{1}{n}$ for each $p(s)$
- This assumption provides $\bar{r}$ as an unbiased estimate of $E(r)$
- However, this assumption provides downward biased (too low) estimates of $\sigma^2$ because we use one degree of freedom to estimate $\bar{r}$
- Therefore, we use an equal probability of $\frac{1}{n-1}$ for each $p(s)$
$$
\hat{\sigma} = \sqrt{\frac{1}{n-1} \sum_{s=1}^n [r(s) - \bar{r}]^2}
$$
