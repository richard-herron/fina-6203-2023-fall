Use time-series returns to estimate the systematic risk ($\\beta$)\n\t2. Use a cross-section of returns to test if riskier assets have higher returns on average\n\n### Testing the single-factor SML\n\n- The CAPM proposes the following expected return-beta relation:\n$$\nE(r_i) = r_f + \\beta_i [E(r_M) - r_f]\n$$\n- We can test this relation with a large sample of monthly stock returns for the same stocks over time; for example:\n\t- $r_{it}$ for 100 stocks over 60 months\n\t- $r_{Mt}$ for the CRSP market index over 60 months\n\t- $r_{ft}$ for the risk-free rate over 60 months\n\n\n### First pass: estimate the SCLs\n\t\n- We estimate the security characteristic line (SCL) for each security:\n$$\nr_{it} - r_{ft} = a_i + b_i (r_{Mt} - r_{ft}) + e_{it}\n$$\n- We collect the following statistics:\n\t- $\\overline{r_i - r_f}$ is the sample average excess return for each of the 100 stocks\n\t- $b_i$ is the $\\beta$ estimate for each of the 100 stocks\n\t- $\\overline{r_M - r_f}$ is the sample average excess return for the market index\n\t- $\\sigma^2(e_i)$ is the variance of the residuals for each of the 100 stocks\n\n### Second pass: estimate the SML\n\n- We estimate the security market line (SML) for the market:\n$$\n\\overline{r_i - r_f} = \\gamma_0 + \\gamma_1 b_i\n$$\n- The CAPM predicts:\n\t- $\\gamma_0 = 0$\n\t- $\\gamma_1 = \\overline{r_M - r_f}$\n- We add $\\sigma^2(e_i)$ and estimate:\n$$\n\\overline{r_i - r_f} = \\gamma_0 + \\gamma_1 b_i + \\gamma_2 \\sigma^2(e_i)\n$$\n- The CAPM predicts:\n\t- $\\gamma_0 = 0$\n\t- $\\gamma_1 = \\overline{r_M - r_f}$\n\t- $\\gamma_2 = 0$\n\n\n### These two-pass tests do not support the CAPM\n\n- The SML is \"too flat\" (i.e., $\\gamma_1 < \\overline{r_M - r_f}$), and the intercept is \"too large\" (i.e., $\\gamma_0 > 0$)\n- There  are several difficulties with these two-pass tests\n\t1. Stock returns are extremely volatile, reducing the precision of average return estimates\n\t1. We have fundamental concerns about the structure of the two-pass tests:\n\t\t1. The market index used is not the CAPM's \"market portfolio\"\n\t\t1. First-stage betas are estimated with sampling error\n\t\t1. Investors cannot borrow at the risk-free rate\n\n### Roll's critique of the CAPM\n\n1. The CAPM has a single testable hypothesis: the market portfolio is mean-variance efficient\n1. All other CAPM implications (e.g., a linear relation between expected return and beta) are not independently testable\n1. If we estimate betas against mean-variance efficient portfolios, they will satisfy the SML relation exactly *ex post* regardless of whether the true market portfolio is mean-variance efficient *ex ante*\n1. The CAPM is not testable unless we include *all assets* in the sample\n1. Using  a market index proxy is subject to two difficulties:\n\t1. The proxy may be mean-variance efficient even when the true market portfolio is not\n\t1. Most proxies are correlated, but different proxies can lead to different conclusions\n\n### Measurement error in beta\n\n- *Problem:* If beta has measurement error and appears as a right-hand-side variable in the second-pass regression:\n\t- $\\gamma_1$ will be biased downward\n\t- $\\gamma_0$ will be biased upward\n- *Solution:* Build portfolios on beta ranks\n\t- @fama_risk_1973 estimate the following regression:\n\t$$\n\t\\overline{r_i - r_f} = \\gamma_0 + \\gamma_1 b_i + \\gamma_2 b_i^2 + \\gamma_3 \\sigma^2(e_i)\n\t$$\n\twhere $i$ indicates a diversified portfolio formed on first-pass betas\n\t- They find:\n\t\t- $\\gamma_0 \\approx 0$\n\t\t- $0 < \\gamma_1 > \\overline{r_M - r_f}$ \n\t\t- $\\gamma_2 \\approx 0$\n\t\t- $\\gamma_3 \\approx 0$\n\n\n### However, recent years have not been kind to the CAPM\n\n- The relation between average returns and beta has weakened\n- @fama_cross_1992 show $\\gamma_1 \\approx 15$ basis points per month instead of the observed excess return of $\\approx 35$ basis points\n- *There is more to the risk-return relation than the CAPM captures*\n\n## Tests of the Multifactor Models\n\n### Three types of factors are likely to augment the market risk factor in a multifactor SML\n\n- These three types of factors are:\n\t1. Factors that hedge consumption against uncertainty in prices (e.g., housing or energy)\n\t1. Factors that hedge future investment opportunities (e.g., interest rates or market volatility)\n\t1. Factors that hedge assets missing from the market index (e.g., labor income or private business)\n- Merton's ICAPM suggests that these extra-market sources of risk will command a risk premium if investors demand to hedge them\n\n\n## Fama-French-Type Factor Models\n\n### The @fama_common_1993 3-factor model (and its variants) is state-of-the-art {.allowframebreaks}\n\n- @fama_common_1993 add two factors to the CAPM based to explain:\n\t- Higher book-to-market firms experience higher returns (HML)\n\t- Smaller firms experience higher returns (SMB)\n- They find that value and size are priced risk factors, consistent with the APT\n\n![CAPM versus the Fama and French model.
