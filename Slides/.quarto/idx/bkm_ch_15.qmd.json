opportunities for arbitrage\n\nThe value of the bond should be the sum of the values of its parts\n\n### Table 15.1 Prices and Yields to Maturities on Zero-Coupon Bonds ($1,000 Face Value)\n\n### Valuing Coupon Bonds\n\n  * Value a 3-year, 10% coupon bond using discount rates from Table 15.1:\n\n  * Price = $1,082.17 and YTM = 6.88%\n  * 6.88% is less than the 3-year rate of 7%\n\n### Bond Pricing: Two Types of Yield Curves\n\n__On-the-Run Yield Curve__\n\nRefers to the plot of yield as a function of maturity for recently issued coupon bonds selling at or near par value\n\nTypically published by the financial press\n\n__Pure Yield Curve__\n\nRefers to the curve for stripped, or zero-coupon, Treasuries\n\nMay differ significantly from the on-the-run yield curve\n\n### The Yield Curve under Certainty\n\n* Consider two 2-year bond strategies:\n  * Buy the 2-year zero offering a 2-year YTM of 6% and hold it until maturity\n    * Face value is $1,000, so it is purchased today for $1,000/(1.06)2 = $890 and matures in two years to $1,000\n    * Total 2-year growth factor is $1,000/$890 = 1.1236\n  * Invest the same $890 in a 1-year zero-coupon bond with a YTM of 5% and upon maturity reinvest the proceeds in another 1-year bond\n\n### Figure 15.2 Two 2-Year Investment Programs\n\n[Access the text alternative for slide images.](slide31.xml)\n\n### Spot Rates and Short Rates\n\n* __Spot rate__\n  * The rate that prevails  _today_  for a time period corresponding to the zero’s maturity\n* __Short rate__\n  * Applies for a given time interval (for example, one year)\n  * Refers to the interest rate for that interval available at different points in time\n\n### Holding-Period Returns\n\n* Multiyear cumulative returns on all competing bonds should be equal\n  * What about HPRs over shorter periods, such as one year?\n* In a world of certainty, all bonds must offer identical returns, or investors will flock to the higher-return securities, bidding up their prices, and reducing their returns\n\n### Figure 15.3 Short Rates versus Spot Rates\n\n[Access the text alternative for slide images.](slide32.xml)\n\n### Forward Rates 1\n\n  * _f_  _n_  = short rate in year  _n_\n  * _y_  _n_  = YTM of a zero-coupon bond with an  _n-_ period       \t      maturity\n\nThe  __forward interest rate __ is a forecast of a future short rate\n\nRate for 4-year maturity = 8%\n\nRate for 3-year maturity = 7%\n\n### Interest Rate Uncertainty and Forward Rates 1\n\n* Move from unrealistic certainty to more realistic uncertainty.\n* The investor wants to invest for 1 year:\n  * Buy the 2-year bond today and sell it at the end of the first year for $1000/1.06 = $943.40\n  * _or_\n  * Buy the 1-year bond today and hold to maturity\n* What if next year’s interest rate differs from 6%?\n  * The actual return on the 2-year bond is uncertain!\n\nInvestors require a risk premium to hold a longer-term bond\n\nThis  __liquidity premium __ compensates short-term investors for the uncertainty about future prices\n\n### Theories of Term Structure\n\n* __Liquidity Preference Theory__\n* Long-term bonds are more risky\n  * _f_  _2_  >  _E_ ( _r_  _2_ )\n* The excess of  _f_  _2_  over  _E_ ( _r_  _2_ ) _ _ is the  _liquidity premium_\n  * Predicted to be positive\n* Yield curve has an upward bias built into the long-term rates because of the liquidity premium\n\n__Expectations Hypothesis Theory__\n\nSimplest theory of the term structure\n\nStates forward rate equals market consensus expectation of future short interest rate\n\n_f_  _2_  _ = E_ ( _r_  _2_ ) _ _ and liquidity premiums are zero\n\n### Yield Curve Examples 1\n\nPanel A:\n\nConstant Expected Short Rate.\n\nLiquidity Premium of 1%.\n\nPanel B:\n\nDeclining Expected Short

Interest Rates\n\nThe  __market segmentation theory __ holds that long- and short-maturity bonds trade in distinct and unconnected markets.\n\nEach market finds its own equilibrium independently\n\nThe term structure is determined by the rates set in these segmented markets.\n\nThis view of the market is less common today; investors must compare long and short rates as well as expectations of future rates before deciding where to invest.\n\n### Interpreting the Term Structure 1\n\n* Yield curve reflects expectations of future short rates, but also reflects other factors such as liquidity premiums\n* An upward sloping curve could indicate:\n  * Rates are expected to rise\n  * _and/or_\n  * Investors require large liquidity premiums to hold long term bonds\n\n* The yield curve is a good predictor of the business cycle\n  * Long-term rates tend to rise in anticipation of economic expansion\n  * Inverted yield curve may indicate that interest rates are expected to fall and signal a recession\n\n### Figure 15.5 Price Volatility of Long-Term Treasury Bonds\n\n[Access the text alternative for slide images.](slide35.xml)\n\n### Figure 15.6 Term Spread: Yields on

curve\n* In general, forward rates will not equal the eventually realized short rate\n  * Still an important consideration when making decisions, such as locking in loan rates\n\n### Figure 15.7

At time 2 is negative $1,000 (1 plus f sub 2).\n\n[Return to parent-slide containing images.](slide27.xml) -->\n\n\n### Summary from @bodie_investments_2023
