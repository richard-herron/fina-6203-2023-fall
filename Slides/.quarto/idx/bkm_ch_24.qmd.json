Broad asset allocation choices across equity, fixed-income, and money markets\n\t1. Industry (sector) choice within each asset class\n\t1. Security choice within each sector\n- This decomposition explains the difference between a managed portfolio $P$ and a benchmark portfolio $B$\n\t- Portfolio $B$ measures the returns on a completely passive strategy, removing *asset allocation* and *security selection* decisions\n\t- Therefore, asset allocation and security selection explain all differences between portfolios $P$ and $B$\n\n![Performance of the managed portfolio [@bodie_investments_2023, Table 24.6]](./Figures/table_2406.png){height=50%}\n\n\n### Contributions of *asset allocation* and *selection*\n\n![Performance
