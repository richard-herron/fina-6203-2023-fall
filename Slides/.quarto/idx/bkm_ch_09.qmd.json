Taxes affect the after-tax returns on the same security\n    - Practically, this doubt is minor, and there is little evidence that taxes are a major factor in stock returns\n    \n\n### Risk-free borrowing and the zero-beta model (assumption 2b)\n\n- Restrictions on borrowing create different tangency portfolios for different investors, creating different optimal risky portfolios\n- @merton_analytic_1972 and @roll_critique_1977 show the following characteristics of efficient portfolios\n  1. Any combination of tangency portfolios is on the efficient frontier\n  1. The market portfolio is an aggregation of efficient portfolios\n  1. Every tangency portfolio has a companion zero-beta portfolio on the bottom half of the frontier, so we can rewrite the CAPM as $E(r_i) - E(r_z) = \\beta_i [E(r_M) - E(r_z)]$, where $E(r_z)$ is the expected return on the zero-beta portfolio and $E(r_z) > r_f$\n- Also, borrowing limits make it difficult for risk-tolerant investors to leverage up the tangency portfolio, pushing them to tilt their portfolios away from low-beta stocks and toward high-beta stocks, pushing prices up and risk premiums down\n- *These limits on borrowing flatten the SML*\n\n\n### Labor income and other nontraded assets (assumption 2a)\n\n- Many assets are not tradeable (e.g., real estate, private businesses, and human capital)\n- For example, employee compensation counted for 60% of national income for the 5 years ending 2021\n- Therefore, the market portfolio may not be the optimal risky portfolio\n- Also, the optimal risky portfolio should differ based on an investor's human capital\n\n\n### Multiperiod model and hedge portfolios\n\n- Investors should be more concerned with the stream of consumption that wealth can buy for them than about the mean and variance of wealth this period (assumption 1a)\n- This assumption rules out concern with the correlation of asset returns with inflation or prices of important goods and services\n- It also rules out demand for assets that could hedge these \"extra-market risks\" that would increase prices and decrease risk premiums\n- Similar extra-market risk factors would arise in a multiperiod model instead of the single-period model (assumption 1b)\n- Demand for these hedging assets would violate the CAPM\n- The intertemporal CAPM (ICAPM) is a multiperiod model that addresses these concerns and models investors who continually adapt their consumption and investment decisions to changes in wealth, prices, and investments\n\n\n### Consumption-based CAPM (CCAPM)\n\n- The discussion on the previous slide centers on consumption\n- The CCAPM centers the CAPM directly on consumption so that the utility of an additional dollar of consumption today must equal the utility of the expected future consumption that could be financed by investing that marginal dollar today\n- Investors value additional income more in states of the world where consumption is low\n- Therefore, equilibrium risk premiums will be greater for assets that exhibit higher covariance with consumption growth\n\n\n### Liquidity and the CAPM (assumption 2d)\n\n- Financial costs inhibit trades and are non-zero\n  - Under the CAPM, there is little reason to trade because all investors share the same information and demand the same portfolios of risk assets\n  - In reality, investors trade because they have different expectations\n- Liquidity of an asset is the ease and speed with which it can be sold at the fair market value\n- Illiquidity can be measured in part by the discount from fair market value a seller must accept if the asset is to be sold quickly\n- Illiquidity can also be measured in part by the spread between the bid and ask prices\n\n\n### Firms with greater liquidity risk have higher average returns\n\n![The relationship between illiquidity and average returns [@bodie_investments_2023, Figure 9.4]](./Figures/bod12665_0904.png){height=75%}\n\n\n## Issues in Testing the CAPM\n\n\n### Testing the CAPM is surprisingly difficult!\n\n- We cannot observe all tradable assets, so we cannot pin down the market portfolio\n- As a result, tests of the CAPM have a \"joint hypothesis problem\"\n- If we test and reject the CAPM, do we reject it because it is the wrong model or because we have the wrong market portfolio (or both)?\n- Alpha and beta, as well as residual variance, are likely time-varying\n- Betas and market risk premiums may not vary *randomly* over time but in response to economic conditions (i.e., similar to the ICAPM and CCAPM)\n- Regarding the ICAPM, we have not found the extra-market risk factors that hedge consumption\n- *Bottom line: some researchers consider the CAPM outdated, but it delivers important insights, and there is no clear replacement*\n\n\n## The CAPM and Investment Industry\n\n\n### Portfolio theory and the CAPM are accepted tools in the practitioner community\n\n- Many professionals think about the distinction between systematic and firm-specific risk and are comfortable with beta as a  measure of systematic risk\n- In the asset management industry, alpha is regularly computed\n- But alpha or other theoretically-appropriate risk-adjusted performance measures are rarely used to compensate portfolio managers\n- We cannot prove that the market index is the most efficiently diversified portfolio\n- But most investors do not beat the market index portfolio\n- Average mutual fund alpha is negative most years, and funds with positive alphas one year have negative alphas the following year\n- Since only a small fraction of professional managers beat the index over ten-year periods, the market index portfolio is efficient for all practical purposes and is used as\n  1.
