Examples: 3Com and Palm\n    - In 1999, 3Com spun off its Palm division with an IPO of 5% of Palm\n    - 3Com committed to spin-off the remaining 95% of Palm by giving each 3Com share 1.5 shares of Palm\n    - Therefore, after the Palm spin-off, 3Com share prices should have been *at least* 1.5 times Palm share prices\n    - However, Palm's share price was *higher* than 3Com's share price!\n    - We can estimate 3Com's *stub value* as 3Com's share price minus Palm's share price\n    - 3Com had assets of $10 per share, so its stub value should have been at least $10\n    - However, 3Com's estimated stub value was *negative* for over two months!\n    - The limit to arbitrage here was that traders had borrowed and sold short almost all available Palm shares\n- Closed-end funds (CEFs)\n  - CEFs often sell at premiums or discounts to NAV\n  - BKM call this *nearly* a violation of the Law of One Price\n    - Might sell at a discount to NAV because NAV does not reflect the fees and expenses that CEF investors will pay in the coming months and years\n    - Might sell at a premium to NAV because NAV does not reflect future investment decisions of the CEF manager\n  - Deviations are larger for CEFs that are difficult to arbitrage\n  - However, there are rational return expectation explanations, too!\n    - We can use the constant-growth dividend discount model to express the CEF discount as\n    $$\n    \\frac{\\text{Price} - \\text{NAV}}{\\text{NAV}} = \\frac{\\alpha - \\varepsilon}{\\delta + \\varepsilon - \\alpha}\n    $$\n    where $\\alpha$ is the risk-adjusted return, $\\delta$ is the dividend yield, and $\\varepsilon$ is the expense ratio\n    - If $\\alpha > \\varepsilon$, the CEF will *rationally* sell at a premium\n    - Most CEFs trade at discounts to NAV, consistent with most managers not covering their expenses\n\n### Bubbles are easier to spot after they end!\n\n- Dot-com bubble\n  - @cooper_rose_2001 show that adding \".com\" to a business name generates abnormal returns!\n  - 6-year period beginning in 1995, where the tech-heavy NASDAQ Index increased its level by a factor of 6\n  - The NASDAQ Index eventually fell 75% from its peak\n  - Can be explained by overconfidence and representativeness biases\n- Housing bubble\n  - Set off the worst financial crisis in 75 years\n  - Again, can be explained by overconfidence and representativeness biases\n- *However,* there are often rational explanations for stock market bubbles using the dividend discount model\n  - S&P 500 is worth $12,883 million if the dividend growth rate is 8% (close to the actual value in 2000)\n  - S&P 500 is worth $8,589 million if the dividend growth rate is 7.4% (close to the actual value in 2002)\n\n### Behavioral finance explanations of efficient market anomalies do not always guide how to exploit them!\n\n- Still, behavioral finance is important because we rely on market prices to allocate capital\n- Inefficient prices, whether we can exploit them or not, can result in inefficient investment\n- Among financial economists:\n  - Many believe behavioral finance is too unstructured and tries to explain too many anomalies from a long list of psychological biases because it is easy to fit an empirical finding to one of these biases\n  - Many do not believe it indicts or refutes the EMH because risk-adjusted profits are small and fleeting\n- *Bottom line:* We should not expect risk-adjusted profits from behavioral finance, but it still provides a useful list of common errors we should avoid as investors and managers\n\n## Technical Analysis and Behavioral Finance\n\n\n### Technical analysis attempts to exploit predictable patterns in stock prices\n\n- Technicians do not deny the usefulness of fundamental analysis\n  - However, they believe that prices adjust gradually to intrinsic values\n  - As a result, they believe they can profit from slow price adjustments when fundamentals change\n- The disposition effect is the tendency of investors to sell winners and hold onto losers\n  - Losses are only \"paper losses\" that investors can ignore until they sell these losers\n  - As a result, the demand for shares depends on price history\n  - For example, investors holding onto their winners can generate momentum in stock prices\n- *Technical analysis and behavioral finance have a lot of overlap*, and we might think of technical analysis as a playbook for exploiting behavioral biases\n\n### Much of technical analysis tries to discover trends in market prices {.allowframebreaks}\n\n- In other words, technical analysis is the search for momentum\n- Moving averages are a popular tool to search for momentum\n  - A moving average is an average price over a given time interval, where the interval updates as time passes\n  - Crossing the moving average from below is a *bullish signal*, signifying a shift from a falling trend to a rising trend\n  - In contrast, crossing the moving average from above is a *bearish signal* \n- Other populr tools are *Elliot wave theory* and *Kondratieff waves*, which decompose price movements into long-term and short-term trends\n\n![Share price and 25-day moving average for Intel, February 1, 2022 [@bodie_investments_2023, Figure 12.3]](./Figures/bod12665_1203.png){height=50%}\n\n\n### Relative strength measures the extent to which a security has outperformed the market or industry\n\n- Calculated as the ratio of the price of the security to a price index for the market or industry\n- A rising ratio implies outperformance and a signal to buy if we assume outperformance will persist\n\n### Breadth measures the extent to which market movements are reflected widely in the price movements of all the stocks in the market {.allowframebreaks}\n\n- The most common breadth measure is the spread between the number of stocks that advance and decline in price\n- Some technicians cumulate breadth each day\n\n![Market Diary [@bodie_investments_2023, Figure 12.5]](./Figures/bod12665_1205.png){height=50%}\n\n![Breadth [@bodie_investments_2023, Table 12.1]](/Figures/table_1201.png){height=50%}\n\n### Machine learning, technical analysis, and Renaissance Technologies (RenTech)\n\n- Machine learning based on past prices and trading data is related to technical analysis\n- One of the most successful hedge funds has been RenTech, which generated before-fee average annual returns of about 66% between 1988 and 2018\n- RenTech's Medallion fund uses machine learning to turn large amounts of data into profitable trades (on average)\n  - Is RenTech's success a violation of EMH?\n  - Unlikely because they admit that only slightly more than 50% of their trades are profitable\n  - RenTech is very good at finding coins with a slight edge and then repeatedly flipping these coins\n  -

The ratio will always be less than one because intermediate-grade yields are always greater than top-rated yields\n  - Higher values are bullish signals, and lower values are bearish signals\n- Short interest\n  -
