Securities","containsRefs":false,"markdown":"\n\n\n### Firms raise funds by borrowing money or selling ownership shares\n\n- Primary market: Offers new securities to the public, and funds flow from buyers to firms\n- Secondary market: Trades existing securities, and funds flow from buyers to sellers\n\n\n### Privately held firms: A small number of managers and investors hold all shares, which do not trade in public markets\n\n- Pros\n\t- Private firms have weaker obligations to disclose information to the public than public firms\n\t- Less disclosure saves money, avoids revealing secrets to competitors, and may help private firms pursue long-term goals without the pressure of quarterly earnings announcements\n\t- Security and Exchange (SEC) Rule 144A private placements avoid lengthy and costly registration statements\n- Cons\n\t- Private placements do not trade in public markets, reducing liquidity and valuations\n\t- Previously limited to 499 shareholders, but the JOBS Act of 2012 increased this limit to 1999 shareholders\n\n\n### Liquidity is the ability to trade an asset in the desired quantity and time at a fair price\n\n- Liquid stocks can be traded in large volumes on short notice without substantially changing their prices\n- Illiquid stocks may be difficult to buy or sell without causing price volatility\n\n\n### Publicly-traded companies: Shares continually trade in public markets\n\n- Initial public offering (IPO): First sale of shares to the general public\n- Seasoned equity offering (SEO): Sale of additional shares in an already-publicly-traded firm \n- Syndicates of investment bankers typically market public offerings of stocks and bonds\n\t- Advise firms on the terms of the offering\n\t- Register the offering with the SEC\n\t- Firm-commitment underwriting: Investment bankers purchase all securities at a discount, compensating the underwriters and eliminating risk for the firm\n\n\n### \"Shelf registrations\" let public firms issue securities on short notice with little additional paperwork\n\n- SEC Rule 415 for seasoned offerings lets already publicly traded firms register securities and gradually sell them to the public over the next three years\n- These securities are \"on the shelf\" and ready for issue\n- Shelf registrations let public firms sell securities in small amounts on short notice with little additional paperwork and low flotation costs\n\n\n### IPOs are a lengthy process for underwriters, who typically bear the risk\n\n- Register security with SEC, and distribute preliminary prospectus to potential investors\n- Travel the country to visit potential investors, generating interest and providing information\n- Estimate investor demand (i.e., price and quantity) by \"book building\"\n- Allocate security to investors, in part based on their expressed interest\n\n\n### IPOs are often underpriced compared to their market prices\n\n- However, some IPO prices are too high and do not fully sell\n- Firm-commitment underwriters bear this risk\n\n\n## How Securities Are Traded\n\n### There are four broad types of markets: Direct-search, brokered, dealer, and auction\n\n- Direct search markets: Buyers and sellers search for each other directly\n\t- Sporadic participation and non-standard goods\n\t- Examples: Craiglist and newspaper ads\n- Brokered markets: Brokers offer search services to connect buyers and sellers\n\t- Examples: Real estate and interdealer markets\n- Dealer markets: Buyers and sellers trade with dealers\n\t- Dealers maintain inventories and profit from the spread between buy and sell prices\n\t- Examples: Bond and foreign exchange markets\n- Auction markets: Buyers and sellers trade with each other directly\n\t- Designated market makers (DMM) maintain orderly markets\n\t- Examples: New York Stock Exchange (NYSE)\n\n\n### There are two broad types of orders: Market and price-contingent\n\n- Market orders execute immediately at the best available price\n\t- Buy orders: Execute at the lowest ask price\n\t- Sell orders: Execute at the highest bid price\n- Price-contingent orders\n\t- Limit orders specify the desired execution price\n\t\t- Buy limit orders: Specify the maximum price the buyer will pay\n\t\t- Sell limit orders: Specify the minimum price the seller will accept\n\t\t- Limit orders may not immediately execute\n\t- Stop orders become market orders when the price reaches a specified price\n\t\t- Buy stop orders: Become market orders when the price rises to or exceeds the specified price\n\t\t- Sell stop orders: Become market orders when the price falls to or below the specified price\n\n\n### Limit order books are collections of limit orders waiting to execute\n\n![A portion of the limit order book for MSFT on the CBOE Global Markets, August 4, 2021 [@bodie_investments_2023, Figure 3.4]](./Figures/bod12665_0304.png){height=50%}\n\n\n### Investors buy and sell shares via brokers, who execute trades on one of several market types\n\n- Over-the-counter (OTC) dealer markets\n\t- Security dealers quote prices to buy or sell securities\n\t- Brokers contact dealers to facilitate trades between buyers and sellers\n- Electronic communication networks (ECNs)\n\t- Participants electronically submit market and limit orders\n\t- Orders match automatically without broker intervention\n\t- Offers speed, anonymity, and cost advantages\n- Specialist markets (largely replaced by ECNs)\n\t- Exchanges assign specialists to manage each security\n\t- Specialists maintain the limit order book, execute trades, provide liquidity, and maintain a fair and orderly market\n\n\n###\n\n![](./Questions/bkm_ch_03_05.png){height=50%}\n\n\n###\n\n![](./Questions/bkm_ch_03_06.png){height=50%}\n\n\n###\n\n![](./Questions/bkm_ch_03_07.png){height=50%}\n\n\n\n## The Rise of Electronic Trading\n\n### ECNs are the dominant market type and have steadily increased their share in the U.S. {.allowframebreaks}\n\n- New regulations allowed brokers to compete, broke the hold of dealers on price information, forced market integration, and allowed smaller price increments (tick sizes)\n- Technology enabled rapid price comparison and directed trades to markets with the best prices, leading to competition between markets and lower trade execution costs\n- The SEC's Regulation National Market System (NMS) facilitated the electronic linkage of exchanges, creating an integrated electronic market\n- Trading today is predominantly electronic, especially for stocks, with the share of electronic trading increasing significantly\n\n![Market share of trading in

allow high-frequency traders to exploit price discrepancies\n\t- Latency times are crucial, with speed being a competitive factor -->\n\n\n## New Trading Strategies\n\n### Electronic trading allows unique strategies\n\n- Algorithmic trading uses computer programs to make trading decisions\n\t- Exploits small price discrepancies\n\t- Strategies include short-term trend trading and pairs trading\n- High-frequency trading is a subset of algorithmic trading based on rapid decision-making\n\t- Trade-execution times measured in milli- or micro-seconds\n\t- Strategies include market-making and cross-market arbitrage\n- Dark pools are trading venues that provide anonymity\n\t- Execute large trades without revealing intentions\n\t- Controversial due to market fragmentation and liquidity impact\n- Bond trading still occurs primarily in the OTC market among bond dealers\n\n\n## Globalization of Stock Markets\n\n### U.S. stock markets have about half of the worldwide stock market capitalization, but many markets have international allegiances\n\n![The biggest stock markets in the world by domestic market capitalization [@bodie_investments_2023, Figure 3.7]](./Figures/bod12665_0307.png){height=50%}\n\n\n## Trading Costs\n\n### Trading costs are both explicit and implicit\n\n- Explicit costs include fees and commissions\n\t- Full-service brokers provide a wide range of services and advice\n\t- Discount brokers provide low-cost, no-frills service\n- Implicit costs include bid-ask spreads and price concessions for large orders\n\t- Bid-ask spreads compensate for providing liquidity and facing adverse selection\n\t- Spreads are wider for stocks with smaller market capitalization, lower liquidity, and fewer analysts\n\t- To trade large orders, buyers and sellers may need to accept less attractive prices\n\n\n## Buying on Margin\n\n### Investors can access debt financing with \"brokerâ€™s call loans\"\n\n- \"Buying on margin\" is borrowing part of the purchase price \n- The *margin* is the portion of the purchase price contributed by the investor, where:\n$$\n\\text{Margin} = \\frac{\\text{Equity in account}}{\\text{Value of stock}}\n$$\n- The *initial margin* requirement is 50%, set by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System\n- The *maintenance margin* is the minimum equity that investors must keep in the margin account\n- A *margin call* occurs if the margin falls below the maintenance level\n\n<!-- TODO Add several margin problems

Sales\n\n### Short sales let an investor profit from security price declines by selling high and *then* buying low \n\n- Investor borrows a stock from a broker and then sells it, expecting to repurchase it at a lower price\n- Short sale proceeds must be kept on account with the broker, per exchange rules\n- Investor \"covers the short position\" by purchasing a share and returning it (plus any dividends paid during the short sale)\n\n\n### Comparison of cash flows from long and short positions\n\n![Cash flows from purchasing versus short-selling shares of stock [@bodie_investments_2023,

Regulation of Securities Markets\n\n### A handful of laws and organizations regulate U.S. securities markets {.allowframebreaks}\n\n- The Securities Act of 1933 mandates disclosure for new issues\n- The Securities and Exchange Act of 1934\n\t- Establishes the SEC to administer the 1933 act\n\t- Extends the disclosure mandate to existing issues\n\t- Empowers the SEC to register and regulate\n- The Securities Investor Protection Act of 1970 protects investors from brokerage failures\n- *Blue sky laws* are state laws that give investors clearer views of investments\n- The Sarbanes-Oxley Act
