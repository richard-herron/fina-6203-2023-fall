consists of longer-term debt instruments than the money market\n\n- Often called the fixed-income capital market\n\t- Fixed-income: Promises a fixed stream of income\n\t- Capital market: Finances real assets with longer-term borrowing\n- Securities\n\t- Treasury notes (maturity up to 10 years) and bonds (maturity beyond 10 years)\n\t- Inflation-protected Treasury bonds (e.g., TIPS in the U.S.)\n\t- Federal agency debt\n\t- International bonds\n\t- Municipal bonds\n\t- Corporate bonds\n\t- Mortgage and asset-backed securities\n\n\n### T-bond & T-note quotes are per $100 of face and yields are twice the semiannual yield\n\n![Listing of Treasury bonds and notes [@bodie_investments_2023, Figure 2.3]](./Figures/bod12665_0203.png){height=50%}\n\n\n### Municipal bond interest income is tax-exempt in the U.S., so investors accept lower yields\n\n- For the marginal investor, the after-tax yield on taxable bonds must equal the after-tax yield on tax-free \"munis\"\n- Therefore:\n$$\nr_{taxable}(1-t) = r_{muni}\n$$\nwhere $r$ values are yields and $t$ is the marginal tax rate, so the cutoff tax bracket is:\n$$\nt = 1 - \\frac{r_{muni}}{r_{taxable}}\n$$\n\n\n### The ratio of yields on municipal to Baa-rated corporate bonds varies over time\n\n![Ratio of yields on municipal debt to corporate Baa-rated debt [@bodie_investments_2023, Figure

Common stock is an ownership share in a corporation and offers a share in votes and financial benefits\n\n- Owners elect a board of directors with one vote per share\n\t- The board controls the corporation\n\t- The board only meets a few times a year, so it selects managers to run the corporation on a day-to-day basis\n\t- The board motivates and monitors these managers to act in the best interest of owners\n- Owners share proportionally in corporate profits via dividends\n\n\n### Common stock is a residual claim on the corporation with limited liability\n\n- \"Residual claim\" means that stockholders are last in line to claim\n\tcorporate assets and income\n\t- For a corporation in liquidation: Tax authorities, employees, suppliers, bondholders, and creditors are paid before stockholders\n\t- For a corporation not in liquidation: Stockholder residual claims are either reinvested or paid out as a dividend\n- \"Limited liability\" means that stockholders cannot lose more than their initial investment\n\t- Limited liability is in contrast to owners of unincorporated firms, whose creditors can claim owner personal assets\n\n\n### Common stock quotes are per share and provide other salient information\n\n![Listing of stocks traded on the New York Stock Exchange [@bodie_investments_2023, Figure 2.8]](./Figures/bod12665_0208.png){height=50%}\n\n\n### Preferred stock is a hybrid security with features similar to bonds and equity\n\n- Like bonds\n\t- Promises to pay a fixed income each year as dividends\n\t- Does not offer voting rights to control the firm\n- Like equity\n\t- No obligation to pay dividends\n\t- However, preferred dividends are typically cumulative, so they cumulate and are paid before common stock receives dividends\n\t- Preferred dividends are not a tax-deductible expense for the paying firm\n\t- Preferred dividends are a partially tax-deductible income for the receiving firm\n\n\n### American Depositary Receipts (ADRs) trade in the U.S. and represent shares of a foreign corporation\n\n- ADRs make it easier for foreign corporations to meet U.S. security registration requirements\n- ADRs are the most common way for U.S. investors to invest in shares of foreign corporations directly\n\n\n## Stock and Bond Market Indexes\n\n### The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) is a price-weighted index of 30 \"blue-chip\" corporations\n\n- Originally computed as the average share price of stocks in the index\n\t- The percentage change in the DJIA measures the returns (excluding dividends) on a portfolio that holds one share of each stock\n\t- The dollar investment in each stock is proportional to its share price\n\t- So, the DJIA is a price-weighted index\n- The DJIA is no longer the average share price to avoid jumps in the index following stock splits, large dividends, and new stocks\n- Instead, the DJIA is the sum of prices divided by a divisor, adjusted after events to keep the same index level\n\n\n### The S&P 500 stock index is a market-value-weighted index of 500 large stocks\n\n- The S&P 500 provides 2 advantages over the DJIA\n\t- Bigger basket of stocks representing more of the stock market\n\t- Market-value-weighted instead of price-weighted\n- Price-weighted and market-value-weighted indexes have\n\tdifferent interpretations\n\t- Price-weighted: Portfolio of investment of one share in each stock\n\t- Market-value-weighted: Portfolio of investment in each stock proportional to market capitalization\n\t- *Neither is a total return index that accounts for dividends*\n\n\n### There are many other indexes!\n\n- Russell Indexes are market-value-weighted indexes of several slices of the 4,000 largest stocks by market capitalization\n- NYSE, NASDAQ, Wilshire 5000, etc.\n- Equal-weighted indexes make equal dollar investments in each stock, regardless of its price or market capitalization\n\t- Easy to calculate portfolio returns as the average of stock returns\n\t- However, equal-weighted indexes must rebalance every period to get back to equal portfolio weights (i.e., $\\frac{1}{N}$)\n- Foreign and international stock market indexes\n- Bond indexes, although bond indexes are difficult to calculate because bonds trade less frequently than stocks\n\n\n###\n\n![](./Questions/bkm_ch_02_10.png){height=50%}\n\n\n###\n\n![](./Questions/bkm_ch_02_11.png){height=50%}\n\n\n## Derivatives Markets\n\n### The payoffs of futures, options, and derivatives depend on the values of other variables\n\n- Other variables: Commodity prices, bond prices, stock prices, interest rates, or index levels\n- Options\n\t- A *call* option gives its holder the right (but not the obligation) to *buy* a specific asset at a specific price (exercise or strike) on or before a specific date (expiration or expiry)\n\t- A *put* option is similar but gives its holder the right to *sell*\n- Futures\n\t- A futures contract is an obligation to deliver a specific asset at a specific delivery date (maturity date) at a specific price (futures price)\n\t- The long position commits to purchase, and the short position commits to sell\n\n\n## Summary and Key Equations {.allowframebreaks}\n\n![Chapter 2 summary from
