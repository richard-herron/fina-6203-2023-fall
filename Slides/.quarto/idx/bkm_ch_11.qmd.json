@mclean_does_2016 find exactly this!\n  - They test 97 anomalies and find that\n    - Returns are 28% lower out-of-sample, suggesting at least some anomalies are data snooping\n    - Returns are 58% lower after publication, suggesting investors learn from academic research and profit from exploiting mispricings\n    - Anomalies are more persistent for stocks that are difficult to arbitrage (i.e., small, illiquid, and risky stocks)\n\n\n### Are tulip mania, the South Sea Bubble, and the dot-com boom and bust show that prices are arbitrary?\n\n- Probably not, and obvious trading opportunities are not abundant\n- Most bubbles are obvious only in retrospect, and price run-ups typically have reasonable explanations\n- Security valuation is difficult, and intrinsic value estimates are imprecise\n- Even if prices are \"wrong\", taking advantage of mispricings can be difficult\n  - Short-selling is expensive\n  - You may not get the securities you want to sell short\n  - Prices can move against you in the short term, wiping out your capital\n\n\n## Mutual Fund and Analyst Performance\n\n\n### Can skilled investors make consistent abnormal trading profits?\n\n- This is the definition of market efficiency we care about!\n- We will consider the evidence of\n  - Stock market analyst recommendations\n  - Mutual fund managers\n\n\n### Stock market analysts are overwhelmingly positive in their assessments of firms\n\n- Stock market analysts typically work for brokerage firms, so they may be conflicted\n- On a scale of 1 (strong buy) to 5 (strong sell), the average recommendation in 1996 was 2.04\n- So, we typically focus on *changes* in recommendations instead of levels, and some researchers find that positive changes are associated with price increases and negative changes are associated with price decreases\n- However, other researchers find that trading strategies based on recommendations trade heavily and have associated trading costs that wipe out potential profits \n\n\n### There is little evidence that professionally managed portfolios can consistently beat the market\n\n\n![Consistency of Investments Results [@bodie_investments_2023, Table 11.1]](./Figures/table_1101.png){height=75%}\n\n![Mutual fund alphas computer using a four-factor model of expected return, 1993--2007. (The best and worst 2.5% of observations are excluded from this distribution.) [@bodie_investments_2023, Figure 11.8]](./Figures/bod12665_1108.png){height=75%}\n\n![Risk-adjusted performance in ranking quarter and following quarter [@bodie_investments_2023, Figure 11.9]](./Figures/bod12665_1109.png){height=75%}\n\n- However, @berk_mutual_2004 provide important nuance to the findings above\n- They argue that skilled mutual fund managers with abnormal returns attract new investors until the costs and challenges of managing a larger mutual fund drive alpha to zero\n- So, skill appears as large assets under management (AUM) instead of large abnormal returns\n- Therefore, alphas are short-lived, even if managers have skill\n\n\n### So, Are Markets Efficient?\n\n- Enough anomalies exist in the empirical evidence to justify the search for underpriced securities that takes place\n- However, the market is competitive enough that only differentially superior information or insight will earn money\n- Margin of superiority that any professional manager can add is so slight that the statistician will not easily be able to detect it\n\n\n### Summary from @bodie_investments_2023
