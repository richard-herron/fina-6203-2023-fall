abnormal returns attract new investors until the costs and challenges of managing a larger mutual fund drive alpha to zero\n- So, skill appears as large assets under management (AUM) instead of large abnormal returns\n- Therefore, alphas are short-lived, even if managers have skill\n\n\n### So, are markets efficient?\n\n- Enough anomalies exist in the empirical evidence to continue the search for underpriced securities\n- However, the market is competitive enough that only superior information or insight will earn money\n- The margin of superiority that any professional manager adds is so slight that the statistician will not easily be able to detect it\n\n\n### Summary from @bodie_investments_2023 {.appendix}\n\n![](./Figures/summary_11.png){height=75%}\n\n\n### Key equations from
