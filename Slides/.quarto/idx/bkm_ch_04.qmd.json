Record keeping and administration\n\t1. Diversification and divisibility\n\t1. Professional management\n\t1. Lower transaction costs\n- The value of each share in an investment company is called the *net asset value* (NAV) where\n$$\n\\text{Net asset value} = \\frac{\\text{Market value of assets} - \\text{Liabilities}}{\\text{Shares outstanding}}\n$$\n\n## Types of Investment Companies\n\n### Unit investment trusts are pools of money invested in a portfolio that is fixed for the life of the fund\n\n- Sponsor buys securities, deposits them into a trust, then sells shares in the trust called *redeemable trust certificates*\n- The fund's trustees pay out all income to shareholders\n- Portfolio composition is fixed, so there is little active management, and these trusts are often called *unmanaged*\n- Sponsors earn profits by selling shares at a premium to NAV\n- Investors may sell their shares back to the trust at NAV\n- Unmanaged funds have steadily lost market share to managed funds over the past few decades\n\n### There are two types of managed funds: Closed-end and open-end\n\n- Shareholders elect a board of directors, who then hire a management company\n- Management fees range from 0.2% to 1.25% of assets\n- For example, Fidelity Management and Research Corporation sponsors many Fidelity mutual funds and is responsible for managing the portfolios\n\n### Open-end and closed-end funds have different structures\n\n- Open-end funds are ready to redeem or issue shares at NAV\n- In contrast, closed-end funds do not redeem or issue shares\n- Instead, investors trade shares on stock exchanges like any other stock\n\n### Closed-end fund prices may trade at a premium or discount to NAV\n\n![Closed-end mutual funds [@bodie_investments_2023, Figure 4.1]](Figures/bod12665_0401.png){height=50%}\n\n### Exchange-traded funds (ETFs) combine features of open-end and closed-end funds\n\n- Like open-end funds, ETFs issue and redeem shares NAV\n- Like closed-end funds, ETFs trade on stock exchanges and may trade at a premium or discount to NAV\n- Since 1993, unmanaged ETFs have tracked indexes, providing exposure to particular markets or sectors\n- Since 2008, managed ETFs have been available\n- ETFs have gained popularity due to their low costs and flexibility for investors\n\n### Other investment companies include commingled funds, real estate investment trusts (REITs), and hedge funds\n\n- Commingled funds are partnerships of investors that pool funds, similar to open-end funds\n- REITs\n\t- Similar to closed-end funds and invest in real estate or loans secured by real estate\n\t- Most are highly levered, with typical debt-to-assets ratios of 70%\n\t- *Equity trusts* invest in real estate directly\n\t- *Mortgage trusts* invest in mortgages and construction loans\n- Hedge funds\n\t- Private investment partnerships that are typically open only to accredited investors\n\t- Hedge funds have more flexibility in investment strategies and can use leverage and derivatives\n\t- Hedge funds often charge a performance fee based on the fund's returns\n\n## Mutual Funds\n\n### Mutual funds are the common name for open-end funds and account for about 80% of investment company assets\n\n- Each mutual fund has a specified investment policy\n- Management companies often manage a family of mutual funds, making it easy for investors to allocate across market sectors and move assets across funds while benefiting from centralized record keeping\n\n### Mutual funds are commonly classified by investment policy\n\n- Money market funds\n- Equity funds\n- Sector funds\n- Bond funds\n- International funds\n- Balanced funds,\n- Asset allocation and flexible funds\n- Index funds\n\n### Money market funds invest in money market securities, such as Treasury bills, commercial paper, repurchase agreements, and CDs\n\n- Average maturity of these investments is about one month\n- These funds usually offer check-writing features and fix NAV at one dollar per share, removing tax implications of redemptions\n- Money market funds are classified as *prime* versus *government*\n\t- Prime funds hold commercial paper or bank CDs\n\t- Government funds hold short-term U.S. Treasury or agency securities\n\n### Equity funds invest primarily in stock but may also hold fixed-income or other types of securities\n\n- For example, equity funds typically hold a small fraction of assets in money market securities to provide liquidity to meet share redemptions\n- Stock funds are traditionally classified by their emphasis on *capital appreciation* versus *current income*\n\t- *Income funds* hold shares of firms with consistently high dividend yields\n\t- *Growth funds* focus on prospects for capital gains and are typically riskier than income funds\n\n### *Sector funds* focus on an industry or country\n\n- For example, Fidelity has many \"select funds\" that invest in a specific industry, such as biotechnology, utilities, energy, or telecommunications\n\n### Bonds funds specialize in the fixed-income sector\n\n- The fixed-income sector offers room for further specialization!\n- Specialization includes corporate bonds, Treasury bonds, mortgage-backed securities, and (tax-free) municipal bonds\n- Some municipal bond funds invest only in bonds of a particular state or city!\n- Other funds specialize by maturity or credit risk\n\n### International funds invest outside the U.S.\n\n- Global funds invest in securities worldwide, including the U.S.\n- International funds invest in securities of firms located outside the U.S.\n- Regional funds invest in a particular part of the world\n- Emerging market funds invest in companies of developing nations\n\n### Balanced funds are designed to be an individual’s entire investment portfolio\n\n- Balanced funds hold equities and fixed-income securities in stable proportions\n- Life-cycle funds are balanced funds in which the asset mix can range from aggressive (primarily marketed to younger investors) to conservative\n(directed at older investors)\n\t- Static allocation life-cycle funds maintain a stable mix across stocks and bonds\n\t- Targeted-maturity funds gradually become more conservative as the investor ages\n- Many balanced funds are *funds of funds* that invest in shares of other mutual funds\n\n### Asset allocation and flexible funds hold stocks and bonds but may vary their proportions\n\n- The proportions vary based on the portfolio manager’s forecast of the relative performance \n- Therefore, these funds are engaged in market timing and are not designed to be low-risk (or low-fee) investments\n\n### Index funds try to match the performance of a broad market index\n\n- An index fund buys securities included in a particular index in proportion to each security’s representation in that index\n- For example, the Vanguard 500 Index Fund replicates the composition of the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index\n- Index funds provide a low-cost way for small investors to pursue a passive investment strategy\n- Index funds can be tied to non-equity indexes, too\n\n### U.S. mutual funds by investment classification\n\n![U.S. mutual funds by investment classification [@bodie_investments_2023, Table 4.1]](Figures/table_0401.png){height=50%}\n\n## Costs of Investing in Mutual Funds\n\n### Mutual fund investors should consider fund investment policy and past performance, as well as management fees and other expenses\n\n- Operating expenses are costs incurred by the mutual fund\n- Commission expenses are primarily paid to brokers\n\t- Front-end loads are commissions paid when you purchase shares\n\t- Back-end loads are redemption or \"exit\" fees paid when you sell shares (formally known as \"contingent deferred sales loads\")\n\t- 12b-1 charges are fees on 12b-1 funds that cover advertising, reports, and broker commissions\n\t- Alternatively, investors may hire fee-only financial managers who charge directly for services instead of collecting commissions\n\n### The mutual fund rate of return is the change in NAV plus income and capital gains distributions, expressed as a fraction of the beginning NAV\n\n$$\n\\text{Rate of return} = \\frac{\\text{NAV}_1 - \\text{NAV}_0 + \\text{Income and cap.\\ gain dist.}}{\\text{NAV}_0}\n$$\n\n### Fees can have a big effect on performance!\n\n![Impact of costs on investment performance [@bodie_investments_2023, Table 4.2]](Figures/table_0402.png){height=50%}\n\n## Taxation of Mutual Fund Income\n\n### Mutual funds have \"pass-through status,\" so investors pay taxes instead funds\n\n- Capital gains and dividends pass through to investors\n- This pass-through is a disadvantage\n\t- If you manage your portfolio, you can time sales to manage taxes\n\t- However, when you invest through mutual funds, you cannot time individual security sales to manage taxes\n- Therefore, mutual funds with high turnover can be \"tax inefficient\"\n\t- Turnover is the ratio of the trading activity to assets \n\t- Capital gains and losses are constantly realized in high-turnover funds\n\t- Index funds may have turnover as low as 2%, which is tax-efficient and has low trading costs\n\n## Exchange-Traded Funds\n\n### ETFs let investors trade portfolios just as they trade shares of stock\n\n- The first ETF was the Standard & Poor's Depository Receipt (SPDR), which matches the S&P 500\n- ETFs trade throughout the day at the market price, while mutual funds only trade  at the end of the day at NAV\n- Starting in 2008, the SEC approved actively managed ETFs, often called *smart beta* funds\n- Exchange-traded notes (ETNs) and exchange-traded vehicles (ETVs) provide payoffs linked to indexes but invest in \"total return swaps\" instead of the underlying assets, providing liquidity to thinly traded (or non-traded) asset classes\n\n### ETFs offer advantages and disadvantages relative to mutual funds\n\n- ETF advantages relative to mutual funds\n\t- ETFs trade continuously at a market price\n\t- ETFs are tax efficient because redemptions do not trigger capital gains or losses for other investors\n- ETF disadvantages relative to mutual funds\n\t- ETF prices may depart from NAV\n\t- ETF purchases may involve a broker commission\n\n## Mutual Fund Investment Performance: A First Look\n\n### The asset-weighted average return on U.S. equity mutual funds was below the Wilshire 5000 index fund in 30 of 50 years between 1971 and 2020\n\n![Rates of return on actively managed U.S. equity funds versus Wilshire 5000 index, 1971-2020 [@bodie_investments_2023, Figure 4.4]](Figures/bod12665_0404.png){height=50%}\n\n##
