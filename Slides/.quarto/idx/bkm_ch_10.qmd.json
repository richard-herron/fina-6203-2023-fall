A factor model can describe security returns\n  1. There are sufficient securities to diversify away the idiosyncratic risk\n  1. Well-functioning security markets do not allow for the persistence of arbitrage opportunities\n\n\n###  An arbitrage opportunity exists when an investor can earn a riskless profit without making a net investment\n\n- A simple example would be if shares of a stock sold for different prices on two different exchanges\n- The *Law of One Price* states that two assets that are the same in all economically relevant aspects should have the same price\n- *Arbitrageurs* enforce the Law of One Price\n\t- If they observe a violation, they engage in *arbitrage activity* by simultaneously buying the cheap asset and selling the expensive asset\n\t- These trades bid up (down) the price that is low (high) until the arbitrage opportunity goes away\n\n### In a well-diversified portfolio, the firm-specific risk becomes negligible so that only factor risk remains {.allowframebreaks}\n\n- Consider the excess return $R_P$ on an $n$-stock portfolio:\n$$\nR_P = E(R_P) + \\beta_P F + e_P\n$$\nwhere\n$E(R_P) = \\sum_{i=1}^n w_i E(R_i)$,\n$\\beta_P = \\sum_{i=1}^n w_i \\beta_i$,\n$e_P = \\sum_{i=1}^n e_i$,\nand \n$\\sum_{i=1}^n w_i = 1$\n- $F$ and $e_P$ are two uncorrelated random variables, so portfolio variance $\\sigma_P^2$ is:\n$$\n\\sigma_P^2 = \\beta_P^2 \\sigma_F^2 + \\sigma^2(e_P)\n$$\n- If this portfolio were equally weighted, we could rewrite $\\sigma^2(e_P)$ as:\n$$\n\\scriptstyle\n\\sigma^2(e_P) = \\sum_{i=1}^n w_i^2 \\sigma^2(e_i) = \\sum_{i=1}^n \\left(\\frac{1}{n}\\right)^2 \\sigma^2(e_i) = \\frac{1}{n} \\sum_{i=1}^n \\frac{\\sigma^2(e_i)}{n} = \\frac{1}{n} \\overline{\\sigma}^2(e_i)\n$$\nso the non-systematic variance of the portfolio equals the average non-systematic variance of the stocks divided by $n$\n- Therefore, non-systematic variance decreases as $n$ increases, which is the effect of diversification\n- For a well-diversified portfolio $e_P$ and $\\sigma^2(e_P)$ are effectively zero, so:\n$$\nR_P = E(R_P) + \\beta_P F\n$$\n\n\\framebreak\n\n![Excess returns as a function of the systematic factor: Panel A, Well-diversified portfolio A;
