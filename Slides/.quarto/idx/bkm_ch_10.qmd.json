A factor model can describe security returns\n  1. There are sufficient securities to diversify away the idiosyncratic risk\n  1. Well-functioning security markets do not allow for the persistence of arbitrage opportunities\n\n###  An arbitrage opportunity exists when an investor can earn riskless profits without making a net investment\n\n- A simple example would be if shares of a stock sold for different prices on two different exchanges\n- The *Law of One Price* states that two assets that are the same in all economically relevant aspects should have the same price\n- *Arbitrageurs* enforce the Law of One Price\n- If they observe a violation, they will engage in *arbitrage activity* by simultaneously buying the cheap asset and selling the expensive asset\n- These trades bid up (down) the price where it is low (high) until the arbitrage opportunity goes away\n\n### In a well-diversified portfolio, the firm-specific risk becomes negligible so that only factor risk remains {.allowframebreaks}\n\n- Consider the excess return $R_P$ on an $n$-stock portfolio with weights $w_i$ where $\\sum_{i=1}^n w_i = 1$\n$$\nR_P = E(R_P) + \\beta_P F + e_P\n$$\nwhere $E(R_P) = \\sum_{i=1}^n w_i E(R_i)$, $\\beta_P = \\sum_{i=1}^n w_i \\beta_i$, and $e_P = \\sum_{i=1}^n e_i$\n- There are two uncorrelated random variables on the right-hand side of the equation above, so portfolio variance $\\sigma_P^2$ is\n$$\n\\sigma_P^2 = \\beta_P^2 \\sigma_F^2 + \\sigma^2(e_P)\n$$\n- If this portfolio were equally weighted, we can rewrite $\\sigma^2(e_P)$ as\n$$\n\\sigma^2(e_P) = \\sum_{i=1}^n w_i^2 \\sigma^2(e_i) = \\sum_{i=1}^n \\left(\\frac{1}{n}\\right)^2 \\sigma^2(e_i) = \\frac{1}{n} \\sum_{i=1}^n \\frac{\\sigma^2(e_i)}{n} = \\frac{1}{n} \\overline{\\sigma}^2(e_i)\n$$\nso the non-systematic variance of the portfolio equals the average non-systematic variance of the stocks divided by $n$\n- Therefore, non-systematic variance decreases as $n$ increases, which is the effect of diversification\n- For a well-diversified portfolio $e_P$ and $\\sigma^2(e_P)$ are effectively zero, and\n$$\nR_P = E(R_P) + \\beta_P F\n$$\n- *A well-diversified portfolio* is one with each weight small enough that, for practical purposes, the non-systematic variance is negligible\n\n![Excess returns as a function of the systematic factor: Panel A, Well-diversified portfolio A; Panel B, Single stock S[@bodie_investments_2023, Figure 10.2]](./Figures/bod12665_1002.png){height=50%}\n\n\n## Only systematic or factor risk should be related to portfolio expected returns\n\n![Returns as a function of the systematic factor: An arbitrage opportunity [@bodie_investments_2023, Figure 10.3]](./Figures/bod12665_1003.png){height=50%}\n\n## Risk premiums must be proportional to betas\n\n![An arbitrage opportunity [@bodie_investments_2023, Figure 10.4]](./Figures/bod12665_1004.png){height=50%}\n\n\n## APT and CAPM\n\n### The APT serves many of the same functions as the CAPM\n\n- Both the CAPM and APT\n  -

The profitability factor, RMW for \"robust minus weak,\" is the difference in returns between a diversified portfolio with strong versus weak profitability\n    - The investment factor, CMA for \"conservative minus aggressive,\" is the difference in returns between a diversified portfolio with low versus high investment\n- The overwhelming number of other factors are often called the *factor zoo*\n  -
