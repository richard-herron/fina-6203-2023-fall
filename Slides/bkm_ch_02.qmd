## The Money Market

### The money market consists of short-term and highly marketable debt securities

- Treasury Bills (T--bills)
- Certificates of Deposit (CDs)
- Commercial Paper
- Bankers' Acceptance
- Eurodollars
- Repurchase Agreements (Repos)
- Federal Funds
- Brokers' Calls
- London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR), which the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR) will replace in the U.S.


### Money market securities are low-risk but not risk-free, so they have higher yields than T-bills

## The Bond Market

### The bond market consists of longer-term debt instruments than the money market

- Often called the fixed-income capital market
	- Fixed-income: Promises a fixed stream of income
	- Capital market: Finances real assets with longer-term borrowing
- Securities
	- Treasury notes (maturity up to 10 years) and bonds (maturity beyond 10 years)
	- Inflation-protected Treasury bonds (e.g., TIPS in the U.S.)
	- Federal agency debt
	- International bonds
	- Municipal bonds
	- Corporate bonds
	- Mortgage and asset-backed securities


### T-bond & T-note quotes are per $100 of face and yields are twice the semiannual yield

### Municipal bond interest income is tax-exempt in the U.S., so investors accept lower yields

- For the marginal investor, the after-tax yield on taxable bonds must equal the after-tax yield on tax-free "munis"
- Therefore:
$$
r_{taxable}(1-t) = r_{muni}
$$
where $r$ values are yields and $t$ is the marginal tax rate, so the cutoff tax bracket is:
$$
t = 1 - \frac{r_{muni}}{r_{taxable}}
$$


### The ratio of yields on municipal to Baa-rated corporate bonds varies over time

## Equity Securities

### Common stock is an ownership share in a corporation and offers a share in votes and financial benefits

- Owners elect a board of directors with one vote per share
	- The board controls the corporation
	- The board only meets a few times a year, so it selects managers to run the corporation on a day-to-day basis
	- The board motivates and monitors these managers to act in the best interest of owners
- Owners share proportionally in corporate profits via dividends


### Common stock is a residual claim on the corporation with limited liability

- "Residual claim" means that stockholders are last in line to claim
	corporate assets and income
	- For a corporation in liquidation: Tax authorities, employees, suppliers, bondholders, and creditors are paid before stockholders
	- For a corporation not in liquidation: Stockholder residual claims are either reinvested or paid out as a dividend
- "Limited liability" means that stockholders cannot lose more than their initial investment
	- Limited liability is in contrast to owners of unincorporated firms, whose creditors can claim owner personal assets


### Common stock quotes are per share and provide other salient information

### Preferred stock is a hybrid security with features similar to bonds and equity

- Like bonds
	- Promises to pay a fixed income each year as dividends
	- Does not offer voting rights to control the firm
- Like equity
	- No obligation to pay dividends
	- However, preferred dividends are typically cumulative, so they cumulate and are paid before common stock receives dividends
	- Preferred dividends are not a tax-deductible expense for the paying firm
	- Preferred dividends are a partially tax-deductible income for the receiving firm


### American Depositary Receipts (ADRs) trade in the U.S. and represent shares of a foreign corporation

- ADRs make it easier for foreign corporations to meet U.S. security registration requirements
- ADRs are the most common way for U.S. investors to invest in shares of foreign corporations directly


## Stock and Bond Market Indexes

### The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) is a price-weighted index of 30 "blue-chip" corporations

- Originally computed as the average share price of stocks in the index
	- The percentage change in the DJIA measures the returns (excluding dividends) on a portfolio that holds one share of each stock
	- The dollar investment in each stock is proportional to its share price
	- So, the DJIA is a price-weighted index
- The DJIA is no longer the average share price to avoid jumps in the index following stock splits, large dividends, and new stocks
- Instead, the DJIA is the sum of prices divided by a divisor, adjusted after events to keep the same index level


### The S&P 500 stock index is a market-value-weighted index of 500 large stocks

- The S&P 500 provides 2 advantages over the DJIA
	- Bigger basket of stocks representing more of the stock market
	- Market-value-weighted instead of price-weighted
- Price-weighted and market-value-weighted indexes have
	different interpretations
	- Price-weighted: Portfolio of investment of one share in each stock
	- Market-value-weighted: Portfolio of investment in each stock proportional to market capitalization
	- *Neither is a total return index that accounts for dividends*


### There are many other indexes!

- Russell Indexes are market-value-weighted indexes of several slices of the 4,000 largest stocks by market capitalization
- NYSE, NASDAQ, Wilshire 5000, etc.
- Equal-weighted indexes make equal dollar investments in each stock, regardless of its price or market capitalization
	- Easy to calculate portfolio returns as the average of stock returns
	- However, equal-weighted indexes must rebalance every period to get back to equal portfolio weights (i.e., $\frac{1}{N}$)
- Foreign and international stock market indexes
- Bond indexes, although bond indexes are difficult to calculate because bonds trade less frequently than stocks

## Derivatives Markets

### The payoffs of futures, options, and derivatives depend on the values of other variables

- Other variables: Commodity prices, bond prices, stock prices, interest rates, or index levels
- Options
	- A *call* option gives its holder the right (but not the obligation) to *buy* a specific asset at a specific price (exercise or strike) on or before a specific date (expiration or expiry)
	- A *put* option is similar but gives its holder the right to *sell*
- Futures
	- A futures contract is an obligation to deliver a specific asset at a specific delivery date (maturity date) at a specific price (futures price)
	- The long position commits to purchase, and the short position commits to sell
