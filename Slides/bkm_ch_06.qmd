## Risk and Risk Aversion

### Speculation and gambling are different concepts

- Speculation is accepting risk because we perceive a favorable risk-return trade-off
- Gambling is accepting risk because we enjoy it


### Historical data show risky assets earn a risk premium and most investors are risk averse

- Risk-averse investors 
	- Reject *fair games*, where fair games are risky investments with zero risk premiums
	- Consider only risk-free investments or risky investments with positive risk premiums
- We characterize risk aversion with a utility function
	- A commonly-used utility function is $U = E(r) - \frac{1}{2}A\sigma^2$
	- $A$ is a risk-aversion coefficient, and risk aversion increases as $A$ increases


### An investment is more attractive when its expected return is high and its risk is low

![Utility scores of alternative portfolios for investors with varying degrees of risk aversion [@bodie_investments_2023, Table 6.2]](Figures/table_0602.png){height=50%}


### There are three investor types concerning risk

- Risk-averse investors ($A > 0$) only consider risky portfolios if they have risk premiums
- Risk-neutral investors ($A = 0$) ignore risk and only consider expected returns
- Risk-loving investors ($A < 0$) accept lower expected returns on risky portfolios with higher risk 


### The mean-variance (M-V) criterion ranks portfolios {.allowframebreaks}

The M-V criterion says that portfolio $A$ dominates $B$ if 
$$
E(r_A) \geq E(r_B)
$$
and
$$\sigma_A \leq \sigma_B$$
with at least one strict inequality

<!-- ## Capital Allocation across Risky and Risk-Free Portfolios -->


<!-- ## The Risk-Free Asset -->


## Portfolios of One Risky Asset and a Risk-Free Asset

### The most basic asset allocation choice is between risky and risk-free assets

- We can control risk by changing the portfolio weights on risky and risk-free assets (i.e., $y$ and $1-y$)
- Only governments can issue default-free bonds
	- A security is risk-free with a guaranteed real return only if
		1. its price is inflation-indexed and
		1. its maturity equals the investor's holding period
	- Still, we view U.S. Treasury bills as "the" risk-free asset
	- Many money market instruments are effectively risk-free, too


### The capital allocation line (CAL) plots all available risk-return combinations {.allowframebreaks}

- Consider a portfolio of one risky asset and one risk-free asset
- Allocate $y$ to risky asset $P$ and $1-y$ to the risk-free asset $F$
- The return on complete portfolio $C$ is:
$$
r_C = yr_P + (1-y)r_f
$$
- Therefore, the expected return on the complete portfolio $C$ is:
$$
E(r_C) = yE(r_p) + (1-y)r_f = r_f + y[E(r_P)-r_f]
$$
and its volatility is:
$$
\sigma_C = y\sigma_P
$$

![The investment opportunity set with a risk asset and risk-free asset in the expected return-standard deviation plane [@bodie_investments_2023, Figure 6.3]](Figures/bod12665_0603.png){height=50%}


### The slope of the CAL is the Sharpe ratio

The slope $S$ of the CAL is:
$$
S = \frac{\text{rise}}{\text{run}} = \frac{E(r_P) - r_f}{\sigma_P - 0} = \frac{E(r_P) - r_f}{\sigma_P}
$$
so:
$$
E(r_P) = r_f + S\sigma_C = r_f + \frac{E(r_P) - r_f}{\sigma_P}\sigma_C
$$


### We borrow to earn $E(r_C) > E(r_P)$ {.allowframebreaks}

- $E(r_C) > E(r_P)$ requires $y > 0$
- $y > 0$ requires $1-y < 0$
- $1-y < 0$ is a short position in $F$ (i.e., borrowing or using leverage)
- The CAL is straight if we borrow at $r_f$ (shown above)
- Only the government borrows at $r_f$
- Instead, investors borrow at $r_f^B > r_f$, so the CAL has a kink at $y=1$

## Risk Tolerance and Asset Allocation

### An investor chooses $y$ to maximize utility {.allowframebreaks}

- Recall $U = E(r_C) - \frac{1}{2}A\sigma_C^2$
- To maximize utility, the investor solves the following maximization problem:
$$
\max_y U =  E(r_C) - \frac{1}{2}A\sigma_C^2 = r_f + y[E(r_P) - r_f] - \frac{1}{2}Ay^2\sigma_P^2
$$
so:
$$
y^* = \frac{E(r_P)- r_f}{A\sigma_P^2}
$$

### The normality assumption treats standard deviation as the only measure of risk

- The analysis above is standard
- Still, we might want also to consider
	- VaR and ES to estimate exposure to extreme losses
	- "Black swan" events (i.e., rare but high-impact events)


## Passive Strategies: The Capital Market Line

### The capital market line (CML) plots the opportunity set of *passive* strategies {.allowframebreaks}

- The CML is the CAL based on T-bills and a broad index of common stocks, typically the value-weighted portfolio of all U.S. common stocks
- Why are passive strategies reasonable?
	1. Active strategies require costly research and trading to find and maintain the optimal portfolio
	1. Passive strategies free ride on the research and trading of active strategies, which keep securities fairly priced

### We can use these historical data to estimate $A$!

- Investors solve:
$$
y^* = \frac{E(r_M)- r_f}{A\sigma_M^2}
$$
so:
$$
A = \frac{E(r_M)-r_f}{y^*\sigma_M^2}
$$
- About 69.3% of household net worth is invested in risky assets, so:
$$
A = \frac{0.0887}{0.693 \times 0.2025^2} = 3.12
$$
