## Risk and Risk Aversion

### Speculation and gambling are different concepts

- Speculation is accepting risk because we perceive a favorable risk-return trade-off
- Gambling is accepting risk because we enjoy it

### Historical data clearly show risky assets earn a risk premium and most investors are risk averse

- Risk-averse investors 
	- Reject *fair games* or worse, where fair games are risky investments with zero risk premiums
	- Consider only risk-free investments or risky investments with positive risk premiums
- We characterize risk aversion with a "utility function"
	- A commonly-used utility function is $U = E(r) - \frac{1}{2}A\sigma^2$
	- Here, $A$ is a risk-aversion coefficient, and risk aversion increases as $A$ increases

### An investment is more attractive when its expected return is higher and its risk is lower {.allowframebreaks}

### There are three investor types concerning risk

- Risk-averse investors ($A > 0$) consider risky portfolios only if they have a risk premium
- Risk-neutral investors ($A = 0$) ignore risk and consider only the expected return
- Risk-loving investors ($A < 0$) accept lower expected returns on risky portfolios with higher amounts of risk 

### The mean-variance (M-V) criterion can help us rank portfolios {.allowframebreaks}

The M-V criterion says that portfolio $A$ dominates $B$ if 
$$
E(r_A) \geq E(r_B)
$$
and
$$\sigma_A \leq \sigma_B$$
with at least one strict inequality

### An *indifference curve* connects all portfolios with the same utility

<!-- TODO keep figures in sections/slides -->

<!-- ## Capital Allocation across Risky and Risk-Free Portfolios -->

<!-- ## The Risk-Free Asset -->

## Portfolios of One Risky Asset and a Risk-Free Asset

### The most basic asset allocation choice is between risk-free and risky assets

- We can control risk by changing the portfolio weights on risk-free and risky assets (i.e., $1-y$ and $y$)
- Only governments can issue default-free bonds
	- A security is risk-free with a guaranteed real return only if
		1. its price is inflation-indexed and
		1. its maturity equals the investor's holding period
	- Still, we view U.S. Treasury bills as "the" risk-free asset
	- Also, a broad range of money market instruments are effectively risk-free

### The capital allocation line (CAL) plots all available risk-return combinations {.allowframebreaks}

- Consider a portfolio of one risky asset and one risk-free asset
- Allocate $y$ to risky asset $P$ and $1-y$ to risk-free asset $F$
- The return on our complete portfolio $C$ is
$$
r_C = yr_P + (1-y)r_f
$$
- Therefore, the expected return on the complete portfolio $C$ is
$$
E(r_C) = yE(r_p) + (1-y)r_f = r_f + y[E(r_P)-r_f]
$$
and its volatility is
$$
\sigma_C = y\sigma_P
$$

### The slope of the CAL is the Sharpe ratio

- The slope $S$ of the CAL is
$$
S = \frac{\text{rise}}{\text{run}} = \frac{E(r_P) - r_f}{\sigma_P - 0} = \frac{E(r_P) - r_f}{\sigma_P}
$$
- So we can write the CAL as
$$
E(r_P) = r_f + S\sigma_C = r_f + \frac{E(r_P) - r_f}{\sigma_P}\sigma_C
$$

### We need to borrow to earn $E(r_C) > E(r_P)$ {.allowframebreaks}

- $E(r_C) > E(r_P)$ requires $y > 0$
- $y > 0$ requires $1-y < 0$
- $1-y < 0$ is a short position in $F$ (i.e., borrowing or using leverage)
- The CAL is straight if we borrow at $r_f$ (shown above)
- However, only the government borrows at $r_f$
- Instead, investors borrow at $r_f^B > r_f$, so the CAL has a kink at $y=1$ (shown below)

## Risk Tolerance and Asset Allocation

### An investor chooses $y$ to maximize her utility {.allowframebreaks}

- Recall utility is $U = E(r_C) - \frac{1}{2}A\sigma_C^2$
- To maximize her utility, the investor solves the following maximization problem
$$
\max_y U =  E(r_C) - \frac{1}{2}A\sigma_C^2 = r_f + y[E(r_P) - r_f] - \frac{1}{2}Ay^2\sigma_P^2
$$
and finds
$$
y^* = \frac{E(r_P)- r_f}{A\sigma_P^2}
$$

### Our analysis above assumes normality by treating standard deviation as the only measure of risk

- Our analysis above is standard
- Still, we might want also to consider
	- VaR and ES to estimate exposure to extreme losses
	- "Black swan" events (i.e., rare but high-impact events)

## Passive Strategies: The Capital Market Line

### The capital market line (CML) plots the opportunity set of *passive* strategies {.allowframebreaks}

- The CML is the CAL based on T-bills and a broad index of common stocks
- We typically use the value-weighted portfolio of all U.S. common stocks as this broad index
- Why are passive strategies reasonable?
	1. Active strategies require costly research to find and maintain the optimal portfolio, while passive strategies require very little research and trading
	1. Passive strategies free ride on the research and trading of active strategies, which keep most securities fairly priced

### We can use these historical data to estimate $A$!

- Investors solve
$$
y^* = \frac{E(r_M)- r_f}{A\sigma_M^2}
$$
so
$$
A = \frac{E(r_M)-r_f}{y^*\sigma_M^2}
$$
- About 69.3% of household net worth is invested in risky assets, so
$$
A = \frac{0.0887}{0.693 \times 0.2025^2} = 3.12
$$
