## The Behavioral Critique

### Conventional finance assumes that investors are rational, but behavioral finance does not

- The premise of behavioral finance is that conventional finance ignores how real people make decisions and that people make a difference
- Behavioral finance
  - Does not assume that investors are always rational
  - *Requires "limits to arbitrage" so that rational arbitrageurs cannot force prices to match intrinsic values*
- Conventional finance
  - Assumes that investors are always rational
  - Therefore, prices are correct and equal to the intrinsic value
  - Therefore, markets efficiently allocate resources
  - Consistent with the EMH

### There are two broad categories of irrationalities in behavioral finance

- *Information processing errors:* Investors do not always process information correctly and therefore infer incorrect probability distributions of future returns
- *Behavioral biases:* Even when given the correct probability distribution of returns, investors may make inconsistent or suboptimal decisions

### Information processing errors: People have limited capacity to process information

- Limited attention, underreaction, and overreaction
  - People have limited time and attention
  - Therefore, they rely on _heuristics_  or rules of thumb
  - Limited information processing capacity may also cause them to
    - Overreact to salient information
    - Underreact to less salient information
- Overconfidence
  - Investors tend to overestimate the precision of their beliefs or forecasts
  - Investors tend to overestimate their abilities
  - May lead to excessive trading (and lower returns) and poor corporate investments
- Conservatism
  - Investors are too slow in updating their beliefs in response to new evidence
  - May explain underreaction and momentum 
- Confirmation bias
  - Tendency to interpret new information so it confirms your prior beliefs and disregard information that challenges prior beliefs
  - May explain momentum and long-term reversal
- Extrapolation and pattern recognition
  - People are good at finding patterns, including patterns that are illusions!
  - People are also prone to believe these patterns are likely to persist
  - Representativeness bias:  Act as if a small sample is just as informative as a large sample
  - May explain momentum

### Behavioral biases: Even with perfect information processing, people tend to make irrational decisions

- Framing   
  - The framing of choices affects decisions
  - For example, people may choose differently between uncertainty when framed as potential gains from a low baseline and equivalent potential losses from a high baseline
- Mental accounting
  - A specific form of framing where people segregate certain decisions
  - For example, some investors may prefer stocks that pay high cash dividends because they feel free to spend these dividends without "dipping into capital" by selling a few shares of stock that pay low or no cash dividends
- Regret avoidance
  - Individuals whose decisions turn out badly have more regret when that decision was more unconventional
  - For example, losses on blue-chip stocks are less painful than losses on startups because the blue-chip loss can be attributed to bad luck than a bad decision and cause less regret
- Affect and feelings
  - Investors tend to choose stocks with high _affect_ (i.e., good feelings), driving up prices while simultaneously driving down returns
  - For example, affect and feelings may drive the home bias, where people over-invest in geographically nearby stocks relative to efficient diversification
- Prospect theory
  - Defines a new utility function, providing a new model for how utility-maximizing investors should behave
  - The prospect theory utility function is:
    - Concave (i.e., risk-averse) for gains, as is a conventional utility function
    - Convex (i.e., risk-*seeking*) for losses
    - Centered on a reference point that moves as wealth changes, so investors feel *changes* in wealth instead of *levels* of wealth


### Prospect theory

![Prospect theory. ***Panel A:*** A conventional utility function is defined in terms of wealth and is concave, resulting in risk aversion. [@bodie_investments_2023, Figure 12.1a]](./Figures/bod12665_1201a.png){height=75%}

![Prospect theory. ***Panel B:*** Under loss aversion, the utility function is defined in terms of losses relative to current wealth. It is also convex to the left of the origin, giving rise to risk-seeking behavior in terms of losses. [@bodie_investments_2023, Figure 12.1b]](./Figures/bod12665_1201b.png){height=75%}


### Limits to arbitrage are necessary to prevent rational arbitrageurs from fully exploiting the mistakes of behavioral investors and correctly pricing stocks

- Fundamental risk 
  - "Markets can remain irrational longer than you can remain solvent" -- Keynes
  - Intrinsic value and market value may take too long to converge
  - For example, a mutual fund manager may lose clients (and her job) if short-term performance is poor
- Implementation costs
  - It can be costly and difficult to exploit overpricing
  - Transactions costs and restrictions on short-selling can limit arbitrage activity
  - For example, there may be no shares to borrow, or lenders may recall shares with short-notice
- Model risk
  - What if you have a bad model and the market value is correct?

### Regardless of the above, the Law of One Price should always hold, but it does not! {.allowframebreaks}

- "Siamese Twin" companies
  - Royal Dutch should sell for 1.5 times Shell because they are a joint company that splits profits 60/40
  - However, these shares have deviated from the 1.5 ratio for extended periods
  - These deviations are an example of fundamental risk because the deviations have grown as large at 17%

![Pricing of Royal Dutch relative to Shell (deviation from parity) [@bodie_investments_2023, Figure 12.2]](./Figures/bod12665_1202.png){height=75%}

- Equity carve-outs
  - Examples: 3Com and Palm
    - In 1999, 3Com spun off its Palm division with an IPO of 5% of Palm
    - 3Com committed to spin-off the remaining 95% of Palm by giving each 3Com share 1.5 shares of Palm
    - Therefore, after the Palm spin-off, 3Com share prices should have been *at least* 1.5 times Palm share prices
    - However, Palm's share price was *higher* than 3Com's share price!
    - We can estimate 3Com's *stub value* as 3Com's share price minus Palm's share price
    - 3Com had assets of $10 per share, so its stub value should have been at least $10
    - However, 3Com's estimated stub value was *negative* for over two months!
    - The limit to arbitrage here was that traders had borrowed and sold short almost all available Palm shares
- Closed-end funds (CEFs)
  - CEFs often sell at premiums or discounts to NAV
  - BKM call this *nearly* a violation of the Law of One Price
    - Might sell at a discount to NAV because NAV does not reflect the fees and expenses that CEF investors will pay in the coming months and years
    - Might sell at a premium to NAV because NAV does not reflect future investment decisions of the CEF manager
  - Deviations are larger for CEFs that are difficult to arbitrage
  - However, there are rational return expectation explanations, too!
    - We can use the constant-growth dividend discount model to express the CEF discount as
    $$
    \frac{\text{Price} - \text{NAV}}{\text{NAV}} = \frac{\alpha - \varepsilon}{\delta + \varepsilon - \alpha}
    $$
    where $\alpha$ is the risk-adjusted return, $\delta$ is the dividend yield, and $\varepsilon$ is the expense ratio
    - If $\alpha > \varepsilon$, the CEF will *rationally* sell at a premium
    - Most CEFs trade at discounts to NAV, consistent with most managers not covering their expenses

### Bubbles are easier to spot after they end!

- Dot-com bubble
  - @cooper_rose_2001 show that adding ".com" to a business name generates abnormal returns!
  - 6-year period beginning in 1995, where the tech-heavy NASDAQ Index increased its level by a factor of 6
  - The NASDAQ Index eventually fell 75% from its peak
  - Can be explained by overconfidence and representativeness biases
- Housing bubble
  - Set off the worst financial crisis in 75 years
  - Again, can be explained by overconfidence and representativeness biases
- *However,* there are often rational explanations for stock market bubbles using the dividend discount model
  - S&P 500 is worth $12,883 million if the dividend growth rate is 8% (close to the actual value in 2000)
  - S&P 500 is worth $8,589 million if the dividend growth rate is 7.4% (close to the actual value in 2002)

### Behavioral finance explanations of efficient market anomalies do not always guide how to exploit them!

- Still, behavioral finance is important because we rely on market prices to allocate capital
- Inefficient prices, whether we can exploit them or not, can result in inefficient investment
- Among financial economists:
  - Many believe behavioral finance is too unstructured and tries to explain too many anomalies from a long list of psychological biases because it is easy to fit an empirical finding to one of these biases
  - Many do not believe it indicts or refutes the EMH because risk-adjusted profits are small and fleeting
- *Bottom line:* We should not expect risk-adjusted profits from behavioral finance, but it still provides a useful list of common errors we should avoid as investors and managers

## Technical Analysis and Behavioral Finance


### Technical analysis attempts to exploit recurring and predictable patterns in stock prices to generate superior investment performance

- Technicians do not deny the usefulness of fundamental analysis
  - However, they believe that prices adjust gradually to intrinsic values
  - As a result, they believe they can profit from slow price adjustments when fundamentals change
- The disposition effect is the tendency of investors to sell winners and hold onto losers
  - Losses are only "paper losses" that investors can ignore until they sell these losers
  - As a result, the demand for shares depends on price history
  - For example, investors holding onto their winners can generate momentum in stock prices
- *Technical analysis and behavioral finance have a lot of overlap*, and we might think of technical analysis as a playbook for exploiting behavioral biases

### Much of technical analysis tries to discover trends in market prices

- In other words, technical analysis is the search for momentum
- Moving averages are a popular tool to search for momentum
  - A moving average is an average price over a given time interval, where the interval updates as time passes
  - Crossing the moving average from below is a *bullish signal*, signifying a shift from a falling trend to a rising trend
  - In contrast, crossing the moving average from above is a *bearish signal* 
- Other populr tools are *Elliot wave theory* and *Kondratieff waves*, which decompose price movements into long-term and short-term trends

### Relative strength measures the extent to which a security has outperformed the market or industry

- Calculated as the ratio of the price of the security to a price index for the market or industry
- A rising ratio implies outperformance and a signal to buy if we assume outperformance will persist

### Breadth measures the extent to which market movements are reflected widely in the price movements of all the stocks in the market

- The most common breadth measure is the spread between the number of stocks that advance and decline in price
- Some technicians cumulate breadth each day

### Machine learning, technical analysis, and Renaissance Technologies (RenTech)

- Machine learning based on past prices and trading data is related to technical analysis
- One of the most successful hedge funds has been RenTech, which generated before-fee average annual returns of about 66% between 1988 and 2018
- RenTech's Medallion fund uses machine learning to turn large amounts of data into profitable trades (on average)
  - Is RenTech's success a violation of EMH?
  - Unlikely because they admit that only slightly more than 50% of their trades are profitable
  - RenTech is very good at finding coins with a slight edge and then repeatedly flipping these coins
  - With fast trades and low trading costs, a slight edge grows exponentially!
  - Medallion no longer has outside investors, suggesting that these coins with a slight edge are in limited supply

### *Sentiment* is the general level of optimism

- Trin statistic 
  - Measures the strength of market rise or fall
  $$
  \text{Trin} = \frac{\text{Volume declining/Number declining}}{\text{Voume advancing/Number advancing}} = \frac{\text{Average volume declining}}{\text{Average volume advancing}}
  $$
  - Trin ratios greater than 1 are bearish, whereas ratios less than 1 are bullish
  - However, rising volume in a rising market should not necessarily indicate a larger imbalance of buyers versus sellers because, for every buyer, there is a seller
- Confidence index 
  - Measures trends in the *bond* market, which may soon move to the *stock* market
  - The ratio of the average yield on ten top-rated corporate bonds divided by the average yield on ten intermediate-grade corporate bonds
  - The ratio will always be less than one because intermediate-grade yields are always greater than top-rated yields
  - Higher values are bullish signals, and lower values are bearish signals
- Short interest
  - Total number of shares of stock currently sold short
  - Increased short interest reflects negative sentiment and is a warning sign concerning the stock's prospects
  - However, the bullish interpretation is that traders must eventually cover their shorts, so short interest indicates latent demand
- Put/call ratio
  - The ratio of outstanding put options to outstanding call options, which is typically about 65%
  - A rising put/call ratio is taken as a sign of broad investor pessimism and a coming market decline


### With technical analysis, we can find patterns that do not exist! {.allowframebreaks}
