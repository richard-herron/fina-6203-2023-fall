title: Chapter 12 - Behavioral Finance and Technical Analysis
---

### Chapter Overview

- EMH makes two important predictions
  - Security prices properly reflect whatever information is available to investors
  - Active traders will find it difficult to outperform passive strategies such as holding market indexes
- Tests of market efficiency have focused on the performance of active trading strategies
- Behavioral finance assumes investors are not rational

### Behavioral Finance

__Behavioral Finance__

What if investors don’t behave rationally?

Arbitrageurs are limited and therefore insufficient to force prices to match intrinsic value

__Conventional Finance__

Prices are correct and equal to intrinsic value

Resources are allocated efficiently

Consistent with EMH

### The Behavioral Critique

- Two broad categories of irrationalities
  - __Information Processing: __ Investors do not always process information correctly and therefore infer incorrect probability distributions of future returns
  - __Behavioral Biases: __ Even when given a probability distribution of returns, investors may make inconsistent or suboptimal decisions

### Information Processing1

- __Limited attention, Underreaction, and Overreaction__
  - Reliance on  _heuristics_  due to limited time/attention
- __Overconfidence__
  - Investors tend to overestimate the precision of their beliefs or forecasts
  - Investors tend to overestimate their abilities
- __Conservatism__
- Investors are too slow (too conservative) in updating their beliefs in response to new evidence.

- __Confirmation Bias__
- Tendency to interpret new information in a way that confirms one’s prior beliefs
- Disregard information that challenges prior beliefs
- __Extrapolation and pattern recognition__
  - __Representativeness bias: __ Act as if small sample is just as informative as a large sample
  - Individuals are adept at discerning patterns, even perceiving patterns that may be illusory
  - Overly prone to believe these patterns are likely to persist

### Behavioral Biases

- __Framing__  __ __
  - Decisions affected by how choices are described, such as whether uncertainty is posed as potential gains from a low baseline levels, or as losses from a higher baseline value
- __Mental accounting__
  - Specific form of framing in which people segregate certain decisions
- __Regret avoidance__
  - Individuals who make decisions that turn out badly have more regret when that decision was more unconventional
- __Affect and feelings__
  - Investors tend to choose stocks with high  _affect_ , driving up prices while simultaneously driving down returns

### Figure 12.1A Behavioral Biases: Prospect Theory1

Conventional view: Higher wealth provides higher utility, but at a diminishing rate

Behavioral view: Utility depends on  _changes_  in wealth from current levels, not the  _level_  of wealth. It is convex to the left of the origin  risk-seeking behavior in terms of losses.

### Limits to Arbitrage 1

- Behavioral biases would not matter if rational arbitrageurs could fully exploit the mistakes of behavioral investors
- __Fundamental risk __
  - “Markets can remain irrational longer than you can remain solvent” -- Keynes
  - Intrinsic value and market value may take too long to converge

- __Implementation Costs__
  - Transactions costs and restrictions on short-selling can limit arbitrage activity
- __Model Risk__
  - What if you have a bad model and the market value actually is correct?

### Figure 12.2 Limits to Arbitrage and the Law of One Price 1

- “Siamese Twin” Companies: Royal Dutch should sell for 1.5 times Shell
  - Deviated from parity ratio for extended periods
  - Example of fundamental risk

### Limits to Arbitrage and the Law of One Price 2

- __Equity Carve-Outs__
  - Examples: 3Com and Palm
  - Arbitrage limited by availability of shares for shorting
  - __Closed-End Funds__
  - May sell at premium or discount to NAV
  - Can also be explained by rational return expectations

### Bubbles and Behavioral Economics 1

- Bubbles are easier to spot after they end
  - Dot-com bubble
    - 6-year period beginning in 1995
    - Overconfidence and representativeness biases
  - Housing bubble
    - Set off worst financial crisis in 75 years

Rational explanation for stock market bubble using the dividend discount model:

  - S&P 500 is worth $12,883 million if dividend growth rate is 8% (close to actual value in 2000)
  - S&P 500 is worth $8,589 million if dividend growth rate is 7.4% (close to actual value in 2002)

### Technical Analysis and Behavioral Finance

- Technical analysis attempts to exploit recurring and predictable patterns in stock prices to generate superior investment performance
  - Prices adjust gradually to a new equilibrium
  - Market values and intrinsic values converge slowly
- Disposition effect
  - Demand for shares depends on price history
  - Can lead to momentum in stock prices

### Trends and Corrections

- __Momentum and moving averages__
  - The  _moving average _ is the average price over a given time interval, where the interval updates as time passes
  - _Bullish signal _ signifies a shift from a falling trend to a rising trend
  - _Bearish signal _ signifies price series crossing from above the moving average to below it, representative of the beginning of a downward trend in stock prices

### Technical Analysis: Relative Strength

- __Relative strength__
  - Measures the extent to which a security has outperformed or underperformed either the market as a whole or its particular industry
    - Calculated as the ratio of the price of the security to a price index for the industry
  - Strength of industry relative to the whole market
    - Computed by tracking the ratio of the industry price index to the market price index

### Figure 12.5 Technical Analysis: Breadth

- __Breadth__
  - Measure of the extent to which movement in a market index is reflected widely in the price movements of all the stocks in the market
  - Most common measure is the spread between the number of stocks that advance and decline in price

### Technical Analysis: Sentiment Indicators 1

Ratios above 1.0 are bearish, ratios less than 1.0 are bullish

Rising volume in a rising market should not necessarily indicate a larger imbalance of buyers versus sellers

### Trin Statistic: Example

### Technical Analysis: Sentiment Indicators 2

- __Confidence index__
  - Ratio of the average yield on 10 top-rated corporate bonds divided by the average yield on 10 intermediate-grade corporate bonds
  - Ratio will always be below 1
  - Higher values are bullish signals

- __Short interest__
  - Total number of shares of stock current sold short
  - Increased short interest reflects negative sentiment and is a warning sign concerning the stock’s prospects
- __Put/call ratio__
  - Ratio of outstanding put options to outstanding call options
  - Rising ratio is taken as a sign of broad investor pessimism and a coming market decline

### Technical Analysis: A Warning

- It is possible to perceive patterns that really don’t exist
- Figure 12.6A is based on the real data
  - The graph in panel B was generated using “returns” created by a random-number generator
- Figure 12.7 shows obvious randomness in the weekly price changes behind the two panels in Figure 12.6

Deviation (percent) is on the vertical axis, and dates from January 1990 to August 2002 are on the horizontal. After spiking to 10 in January 1990, the jagged lines drops to trend around negative 5 until October 1990. Following a ragged upward trend, it peaks at 15 in late 1995, and trends horizontally between 4 and 10 until peaking at 15 again in mid-1998. After August 1998, the lines trends downward, ending at negative 5 in August 2002.

Dates on the horizontal axis range from Oct 14, 2018 through Jan 7, 2019. A jagged line tracks Intel’s price over the period, while the 50-day moving average line tracks the up and down movement as a smooth curve. One point where the two lines cross as the actual price moves above the 50-day moving average is labeled A. This is generally taken as a bullish signal because the price is starting to move above the previous moving average. A second point labeled B, where the actual price line touches the moving average line on the way down, is taken as a negative signal since the actual price is beginning to track below the moving average.

# Chapter 12: Behavioral Finance and Technical Analysis

---

## Introduction to Behavioral Finance

- Traditional finance assumes rational behavior and efficient markets
- Behavioral finance incorporates psychology and cognitive biases into finance theory
- Investors often make irrational decisions based on emotions, heuristics, and biases

---

## Heuristics and Biases

- Heuristics: Mental shortcuts used to make decisions quickly
- Biases: Systematic errors in judgment and decision-making

---

## Representative Heuristic

- Investors judge the probability of an event based on its similarity to a prototype or stereotype
- Can lead to mispricing in the stock market

---

## Availability Heuristic

- Investors judge the probability of an event based on how easily examples come to mind
- Recent or vivid events can have a disproportionate influence on decision-making

---

## Overconfidence Bias

- Investors tend to overestimate their own abilities and underestimate risks
- Leads to excessive trading and suboptimal investment decisions

---

## Anchoring Bias

- Investors rely too heavily on an initial piece of information when making decisions
- Can lead to anchoring on irrelevant or outdated information

---

## Loss Aversion

- Investors feel the pain of losses more strongly than the pleasure of gains
- Leads to risk aversion and holding onto losing investments for too long

---

## Mental Accounting

- Investors mentally compartmentalize their money into different accounts
- Can lead to irrational decisions such as taking on excessive risk in one account while being overly conservative in another

---

## Prospect Theory

- Developed by Kahneman and Tversky
- Describes how individuals make decisions under uncertainty
- Losses and gains are valued differently, and individuals are risk-averse in gains and risk-seeking in losses

---

## Technical Analysis

- Technical analysis involves using historical price and volume data to predict future price movements
- Tools and techniques include chart patterns, trend analysis, and moving averages
- Controversial approach with mixed empirical evidence

---

## Chart Patterns

- Chart patterns are graphical representations of historical price data
- Common patterns include head and shoulders, double tops, and triangles
- Investors use these patterns to make buy or sell decisions

---

## Trend Analysis

- Trend analysis involves identifying and following price trends
- Investors aim to buy in an uptrend and sell in a downtrend
- Moving averages are often used to identify trends

---

## Moving Averages

- Moving averages smooth out price data over a specific time period
- Simple moving average (SMA) calculates the average price over a set number of periods
- Exponential moving average (EMA) assigns greater weight to recent prices

---

## Empirical Evidence on Technical Analysis

- Mixed results on the profitability of technical analysis
- Some studies find evidence of short-term predictability, while others find no significant predictive power
- Difficulties in implementation, transaction costs, and data mining bias are important considerations

---

## Conclusion

- Behavioral finance recognizes that investors are not always rational and markets are not always efficient
- Heuristics, biases, and emotions play a significant role in decision-making
- Technical analysis is a popular approach but lacks consistent empirical support

---

## Appendix

- Summary of chapter content
- Key concepts and definitions

---

That concludes Chapter 12 on Behavioral Finance and Technical Analysis.
